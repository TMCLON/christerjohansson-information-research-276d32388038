This article proposes a model of culture and its relationship to information behaviour based on two empirical studies of Taiwanese aborigines' information behaviour.\n    //''Method''//. The research approach is ethnographic and the material was collected through observations, conversations, questionnaires, interviews and relevant documents. In 2003-2004, the author lived with two Taiwan aboriginal tribes, the Yami tribe and the Tsau tribe and conducted forty-two theme-based interviews.\n    //''Analysis''//. Data were analysed with the help of software for qualitative analysis (~NVivo), where all sentences from both interviews and field notes were coded. The conceptual framework used is the sociology of knowledge.\n    //''Results''//. The model of culture and its relationship to information behaviour can show us how to think about the relationship between culture and human information behaviour. This model also identifies elements of the model, which are habitus, tradition and prejudice and suggests how we can apply the concepts of information fullness and emptiness to view the relationship between culture and human information behaviour.\n    //''Conclusions''//. Theoretically, this research puts forward a new model of information behaviour and focuses on the role and the importance of culture when thinking about and studying human information behaviour. Methodologically, this study demonstrates how an ethnographic research method can contribute to exploring the influence that culture has on human life and the details of the human life world and information behaviour.\n\n</div>

A formal graphical model of the scientific communication process is presented in this paper.\n    //''Purpose''//. The purpose of the model is to act as a road map for policy discussions and research concerning the process. In comparison to earlier models found in the literature this model is more detailed, hierarchical and includes more modelling constructs (activities, inputs, outputs, controls, mechanisms).\n    //''Methodology''//. The modelling methodology used is ~IDEF0, a process modelling method, which previously has mainly been used for business process reengineering in the manufacturing industry. The current version of the model consists of thirty-three diagrams, with 113 different activities and over 200 different inputs, outputs, controls and mechanisms.\n    //''Scope''//. The scope of the model is the whole communication value chain, from initial research to the assimilation of research results to improve every-day life. The model treats both informal and formal communication, as well as the publishing of data, but the major focus is on modelling the publishing and indexing of traditional peer reviewed journal articles, as well as the activities of readers to find out about them and access them. The new business models and parallel functions enabled by the Internet, such as open access journals and e-print repositories, are also in focus. \n\n</div>

In this paper, we propose a new approach for developing naÃ¯ve ontology as the basis for optimal information access interfaces for multimedia digital documents intended for novice users.\n    //''Method''//. We try to elicit the knowledge structure of domain novices and patterns of its modification in their searching and learning processes by eye-tracker and showing eye-movements in the post-search interviews.\n    //''Analysis''//. Recorded interview data were fully transcribed and coded using Atlas.ti and analysed following a bottom-up strategy of the constant-comparative technique.\n    //''Results''//. We developed a taxonomy of knowledge modification which includes (1) adding, (2) correcting, (3) limiting, (4) relating, (5) specifying and (6) transforming.\n    //''Conclusion''//.The taxonomy may be expanded and elaborated as the project progress and findings are expected to be incorporated into the design of the naÃ¯ve ontology. The study results provided theoretical implications on knowledge building, methodological implications on data collection using eye-tracker and showing eye-movements in the post-search interviews and useful information on the design of information access interface for novices users. </div>

Box 7009, Tulpehocken Road, Reading, PA 19610-6009, USA//\n\n''@@bgcolor(#ff0000):color(#ffffff):Abstract@@''\n\n''//Introduction//''. This study investigates the processes involved in the development of a broadband community network in the Northeast USA. A community network project was studied by tracing the developmental processes from network design to the stabilisation of information infrastructure.\n''//Method//''. A case study was conducted on the broadband community network. Qualitative data were collected primarily through in-depth interviews, drawing on the retrospective data of diverse stakeholders: strategic policy groups, user groups, technical groups and functional groups. Archival documents from various sources were also collected and analysed to triangulate research findings.\n''//Analysis//''. Qualitative analyses were carried out on the data, which related to ninety-six interviews, 279 archival documents, and twenty-nine survey responses. The data were analyzed with thematic analysis using the Atlas.ti program.\n''//Results//''. The political economy of the development process has biased the development toward private interests and away from the public benefit, and toward lucrative services and intra-organizational connectivity and away from community-oriented uses.\n''//Conclusion//''. This study provides a conceptual base for understanding contemporary and future community networks by illustrating the applicability of the Social Construction of Technology Theory. It suggests that Constructive Technology Assessment would be valuable to include technology users in the technology design process. </div>
<div tiddler="A study of interpersonal information seeking" modifier="Tom Wilson" modified="200704240923" created="200704090944" tags="[[information seeking]] uncertainty [[interpersonal interaction]] Yoon">[[A study of interpersonal information seeking: the role of topic and comment in the articulation of certainty and uncertainty of information need|http://informationr.net/ir/12-2/paper304.html]]\n\nKyunghye Yoon: Computer Science Department, State University of New York at Oswego, Oswego, NY, USA\n\n''Abstract''\n\n    //''Introduction''//. This paper presents the findings of, and discusses, the qualitative analysis of users' information seeking articulation in interpersonal interactions. The discussion is focused on the role of the uncertainty and certainty and the topic and comment in communicating the user's cognitive uncertainty and certainty in the quest for salient information seeking interaction effectiveness.\n    //''Method''//. The study used transcripts of information seeking interaction between information user and a source person and the user's description of the event from a debriefing interview.\n    //''Analysis''//. Qualitative analysis was carried out using the sequence of the uncertainty and certainty and the topic and comment in the user's utterances during the interaction in order to explore the use of these elements. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample and the distribution of responses to each question. Sex differences on key questions were analysed using the Chi-squared test.\n    //''Results''//. The findings suggested some patterns in the employment of uncertainty and certainty and the topic and comment. Users initiated the need description with uncertainty and then provided certainty to describe the need in detail. Both topic and comment were used in every stage of information seeking interaction, based on which the source person provided information.\n    //''Conclusions''//. The study confirmed that the user's certainty and uncertainty are important for describing the user's information need and that both topic and comment are essential to communicate the need. \n\n</div>

The purpose of information systems is to facilitate work activities: here we consider how Activity Theory can be applied in information systems development. Method. The requirements for an analytical model for emancipatory, work-oriented information systems research and practice are specified. Previous research work in Activity Theory is then elaborated to satisfy these requirements in parallel with practical applications.\n''//Elaboration//''. Activity Analysis and Development (~ActAD) which sees work activity as a systemic entity, its constituent elements and networks of activities, is introduced and the information systems viewpoint is applied throughout the elaboration. Information systems development is modelled as an activity, applying the ~ActAD framework.\n''//Results//''. Our contribution is a participatory development model called the Activity Driven ISD Model, aimed at developing work and information systems in parallel, in three phases: understanding the present state of an activity; describing the goal state of the activity; and planning for the transformation to the goal state. \n''//Conclusion.//'' The ~ActAD framework and the Activity Driven ISD Model meet six of the seven criteria set. The seventh requirement will be satisfied after the finalisation of the model. The experiences in our pilot studies concerning its applicability to the practitioners have been encouraging.</div>

In this paper, we discuss the link between information sharing and organizational knowledge production in two very different organizations; a company that handles insurance claims and a small, entrepreneurial hi-tech company. We suggest that this link has not been adequately addressed by studies of information behaviour, though a number of recent papers have proposed that human information behaviour research should appropriate methods from workplace studies and computer-supported cooperative work to provide a richer account of organizational information and knowledge work.\n''//Method//''. Two case studies of sharing practices in Finnish firms were carried out. \n''//Analysis//''. The version of activity theory that has been developed by EngestrÃ¶m and other Finnish researchers was used to analyse the data. This has provided highly specific accounts of information sharing as a constituent of the varied processes that contribute to the development of organizational knowledge. \n''//Results//''. The overall analysis has allowed us to explain how and why organizational information sharing happens in terms that go beyond the cognitive and descriptive accounts of our earlier studies. \n''//Conclusions//''. Information behaviour is a repertoire of actions and operations and judgements about timing and ethics that are brought into play across work cycles and routines. From this perspective, the duality of organizational knowledge becomes clear: it is both individual and collective judgements about how to behave, and the incremental outcome of these judgements, embedded in decisions that support the objects of activity systems. </div>

The common view of topical relevance is limited to topic matching, resulting in information retrieval systems' failure to detect more complex topical connections which are needed to respond to diversified user situations and tasks.\n    ''//Method.//'' Based on the role a piece of information plays in the overall structure of an argument, we have identified four topical relevance types: Direct, Indirect (circumstantial), Context, and Comparison. In the process of creating a speech retrieval test collection, graduate history students made 27,000 topical relevance assessments between Holocaust survivor interview segments and real user topics, using the four relevance types, each on a scale of 0 - 4. They recorded justifications for their assessments and kept detailed Topic Notes.\n    ''//Analysis.//'' We analysed these relevance assessments using a grounded theory approach to arrive at a finer classification of topical relevance types.\n    ''//Results.//'' For example, indirect relevance(a piece of information is connected to the topic indirectly through inference, circumstantial evidence) was refined to Generic Indirect Relevance, Backward Inference (abduction), Forward Inference (deduction), and Inference from Cases (induction), with each subtype being further illustrated and explicated by examples.\n    ''//Conclusion.//'' Each of these refined types of topical relevance plays a special role in reasoning, making a conclusive argument, or performing a task. Incorporating them into information retrieval systems allows users more flexibility and a better focus on their tasks. They can also be used in teaching reasoning skills.</div>

This paper investigates barriers to adolescent information seeking in high school libraries within the framework of Kuhlthau's model of intermediation.\n    //''Method''//: In-depth interviews and corroborating observations were conducted at six high schools in the Pacific Northwest over a sixteen-month period.\n    //''Analysis''//. The data suggest inconsistencies between teacher-librarians' self-perceptions of their role and their daily interactions with students. Harris and Dewdney's principles of information seeking are employed as an analytic framework to provide a structure for categorizing and examining these inconsistencies.\n    //''Results''//. The identified barriers to student information seeking include a lack of collaboration, students' lack of autonomy, limited access to resources, devaluation of interpersonal sharing for academic purposes, lack of affective support, and failure to validate students'; previous experience in seeking information.\n    //''Conclusions''//. These findings suggest future direction for pre- and in-service education of teacher-librarians to prepare them to recognize how the unique barriers within school contexts can constrain both their mediational behaviour and students' information seeking opportunities. \n\n\n</div>

This is the written version of the keynote address (Making user studies matter: Thank you Mister Feynman and Monsieur Foucault) delivered by senior author Dervin. The paper is linked to the Invited Paper in this issue and like that paper, reports on a project involving a dialogue between researchers and practitioners in library and information science, human computer interaction and communication focusing on gaps in our understandings of users and audiences as well as in our efforts to collaborate with each other to conduct and apply research to the design and implementation of information, library, communication, and media systems.\n    Argument. Our main conclusion in Paper 1 was that the traditional modes used for communication in social science research are not doing the job for user and audience studies. We set out five propositions relating to this conclusion: (1) the traditional modes of communicating in the research enterprise are not working; (2) Do the social sciences matter? Some serious and fundamental attacks; (3) a call to focus on the special problematics of the social sciences: agency, structure, power and the good; (4) eschewing scientific recipes and scholarly creeds and bringing back the joys of adventuring and muddling; (5) the paradox of communicatingâ€”freedom is another word for nothing left to lose.\n    Conclusion. We argue for shared dialogue in communicating across the three fields studied here: this will introduce uncertainty, but, rather than relying upon 'authority', the individual will be encouraged through the exploration of that uncertainty, to make their own sense of the offerings of others. \n\n</div>

The purpose of this research is to assess information behaviour as it pertains to operational teams in dynamic safety critical operations. \n''//Method//''. In this paper, I describe some of the problems faced by crews on modern flight decks and suggest a framework modelled on Information Science, Human Factors, and Activity Theory research to assess the distribution of information actions, namely information identification, gathering and use, by teams of users in a dynamic, safety critical environment. \n''//Analysis//''. By analysing the information behaviour of crews who have accidents and those who do not, researchers may be able to ascertain how they make use of (or fail to make use of) essential, safety critical information in their information environment. The ultimate goal of this research is to differentiate the information behaviour associated with the distinct outcomes.\n''//Results//''. This research affords the possibility to discern differences in distributed information behaviour illustrating that crews who err to the point of an accident appear to practice different distributed information behaviour than those who do not. This foundation serves to operationalise team sense-making through illustrating the social practice of information structuring within the activity of the work environment.\n''//Conclusions//''. The distributed information behaviour framework provides a useful structure to study the patterning and organization of information distributed over space and time, to reach a common goal. This framework may allow researchers and investigators alike to identify critical information activity in the negotiation of meaning in high reliability safety critical work, eventually informing safer practice. This framework is applicable to other domains.</div>

This paper conceptualizes the outcomes of information as an analytical construct that synthesizes different understandings of information use. The article focuses on the perspective of the individual person.\n    //''Method''//. The discussion is primarily based on peer-reviewed articles and monographs in the whole field of information science. The items were normally selected from the Library and Information Science Abstracts database by the keywords outcomes, uses and effects of information.\n    //''Analysis''//. Outcome of information is first defined as anything that ensues from the individual's assimilation of a message. The outcomes are then analysed hierarchically by dividing them into categories which are further divided into subcategories, until a concrete enough level is reached.\n    //''Results''//. The main types of information outcome are information use and effect of information, and their most prominent common dimension is apparently mental vs. physical outcomes. As a result of the scrutiny, a taxonomy of information outcomes is presented in a conceptual model.\n    //''Conclusion''//. The model is also a conceptual map of the research area, and indicates a certain imbalance in our knowledge of information outcomes. The model is detailed enough to enable a deductive mode of inquiry, but inductive approaches ought also to be cultivated.</div>

I also attended a conference in Bratislava recently, which will probably lead to a couple of papers appearing in the journal in due course and I'm off to another one in SÃ£o Paulo in November. I sometimes think that retirement would be a good idea!\n\nThe more observant may have noticed that there is an EBSCO logo on the top page: this signifies that, in future, the journal content will be available through their database services, in addition to continuing to be available openly. This will lead to (presumably) very small sums of money trickling into the accounts of Lund University Libraries to help support the journal. So, if you are an institutional user, you'll be doing us a favour by using the EBSCO service when you want to read and download a paperâ€”they'll be available as pdf files and that will probably please some readers.\n\nOne interesting point about the EBSCO deal is that it works on the basis of an 'assumed subscription rate' for the journal: we arrived at $469.00 for Information Research. Some time ago I carried out a user survey (which is due to be repeated soon) and I recall that the most commonly suggested subscription rates were $50 or $100 - perhaps readers will now be aware of what value they are getting out of the journal!\nIn this issue\n\nWe had the first batch of ISIC papers in the last issue and now we have another batch. The last tranche will follow in the January issue. The papers cover a wide variety of information related issues from the information environment of abused children to services for rail passengers and a model of information use for online learning. The passenger information service paper is of interest to me because it covers a problem that is not usually dealt with in the information behaviour literature and a user group outside the over-used arena of educational institutions and tribes.\n\nWe also publish, by invitation, a paper by Dervin and Reinhard, which supports Dervin's Keynote Address at the conference. This reports on a major investigation in the problems and issues perceived by researchers and practitioners about the field of user studies - or audience studies as the equivalent is known in the communication and media studies field. The paper has a very lengthy appendix and one of the advantages of electronic-only publication is that something like this can actually be published. It would be very difficult for a print journal to handle something of this sizeâ€”unless it constituted an entire special issue!\n\nThere are two additional, refereed papers: one deals with the comparison of time-lines of the coverage of the 7th July terrorist attacks in London by the BBC, the Daily Telegraph newspaper and Wikinews, while the other by Vakkari and Talja presents a study of the use of e-journals to support academic tasks, with particular reference to the use of the Finnish National Electronic Library.\n\nAll in all, a pretty diverse bunch of papers, with something to interest just about everyone.\n\n''@@bgcolor(#ff0000):color(#ffffff):Google Analytics@@''\n\n\nI have started to use Google Analytics on all of the pages on the ~InformationR.net site. This service provides detailed statistics on the use of the site and, although it is intended mainly for e-commerce sites, it is also interesting from the point of view of an OA service. The analytics have only been used since the 8th September, but the data make a pretty pattern:\n\n\n[img[http://informationr.net/ir/12-1/editor121.jpg]]\n\n\n''Google Analytics for ~InformationR.net''\n\nAs you can see, the site has had more than 18,000 visits and more than 46,000 page views in the course of just about a month. The distribution of use over the different parts of the site is also useful to know. As you can see from the pie-chart, the top page of the journal has about one third of the total hits, followed by about 15% on the World list of departments... and 6% for the 'Webography' of research methods sites. This was largely news to me, since I had no means, previously, of comparing the demand for different parts of the site. What it points to is that a sensible way of subsidising the journal will be to charge for entries in the directory. After all, departments are paying for entry into various print directories of courses, so why not for this?\n\n[img[http://informationr.net/ir/12-1/editor121_fig2.jpg]]\n\nDistribution of use over pages\n\n''@@bgcolor(#ff0000):color(#ffffff):Endnote@@''\n\nReaders of the journal will be aware that reviews carry links to Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk and that, if you buy a book the journal gets a small percentage of the selling price. However, a small percentage is also given if you use the link to get to Amazon and then buy something else. So, you can help to support Information Research by using one of the links whenever you want to buy anything from Amazon. Instead of having the Amazon url in your bookmarks, why not put a link to one of the review Webpages and click on that to get you to Amazon. If everyone did this we could get, ooh, I don't know, up to a $100 a year :-)\nProfessor Tom Wilson, Publisher/~Editor-in-Chief</div>

With the loss of my volunteer proof-reader, Rae&ndash;Ann Hughes, the checking is an additional load. It is something of a relief, therefore, to know that Lund University Libraries (our host institution for the server) is implementing the journal management package, Open Journal Systems. Together with the Associate Editors, I am in the process of testing the system and hope, shortly, that all submissions will be handled through OJS.\n\nThis said, there is still room for more volunteers to help with the production of the journal: ideally, a proof-reader who knows British English and an XHTML code editor would be very useful. So, if you have a little time on your hands (a vain hope in these days of overwork!), or if you are recently retired and interested in helping the open access movement, do contact me.\n\nAnd, speaking of volunteers, thanks to Elena Maceviciute for her link checking this issue - a bigger task than usual, and to Pedro Dias and Jose Vicente Rodriguez for the Spanish abstracts; again, a much bigger task than previously.\nIn this issue\n\nThe main work of this issue has been in preparing the final batch of papers from the Information Seeking in Context Conference, which was held in Sydney last year. As usual, the range is very wide, from the information needs of Iranian engineers, to the information behaviour of Taiwanese aboriginesâ€”evidence that the information behaviour field is dynamic and growing. Very few of the authors, however, explore the implications of their work for information practice, and I hope that the 2008 conference (to be held in Vilnius, Lithuania) will address this issue.\n\nWe also have five other peer-reviewed papers and another open access case study. The five papers cover very different topics: professional education in Brazil, Internet services in the countries of the European Union, students' use of the Internet for their Finnish Masters' theses, the impact of the Terrorist bombings in Madrid on the 11th March, 2004, on newspaper documentation centres (in Spanish) and a workflow model for scholarly communication. This last one is very long for a paper and the author has provided a link to a .pdf file so that you may print it out more easily. The case study deals with Medical Education Online, which was established (like Information Researh) by an individual, enthused by the idea of open access publishing.\n\nPartly because of the ISIC papers, we have a good geographic spread of papers in this issue: USA - 4, Finland - 3, Japan - 2, Spain - 2, Brazil - 1, Canada - 1, Iran - 1, Singapore - 1, Taiwan - 1, UK - 1.\n\n''@@bgcolor(#ff0000):color(#ffffff):Google Analytics@@''\n\nAs I noted in the previous issue, I now use Google Analytics to monitor the use of the journal and (at the time of writing) I now have four months of data. The data show that the top page of the journal has had 35,323 'unique views' and 66,145 'page views' in this time - which I assume means that each visitor comes back to the top page ('home' on the navigation bar) at least once after the initial click. Extrapolating that for 2006 as a whole suggests that the top page has had 105,969 unique views and 198,435 page views. I've also been using ~OneStat.com since last April and it shows 32,517 page views for the top page in eight months - extrapolating gives us 48,775 for the year, which is significantly fewer than suggested by Google Analytics, so I'm not quite sure what's going on there :-). However, in 2005 we had 47,117 hits, so usage continues to increase. One thing is certain: the papers in Information Research are getting a lot of exposure!\n\n''@@bgcolor(#ff0000):color(#ffffff):The Editorial Board@@''\n\nI am making changes to the Editorial Board, with a view to stabilizing membership by the beginning of the next volume. Membership is for a period of three years, renewable, and some members are now due to retire, so with this issue, we welcome three new members of the Editorial Board: Jim Jansen, Victor Kaptelinin and Bonnie Nardi. Jim strengthens our representation of the Web research community, while Bonnie and Victor, apart from helping review papers for the activity theory issue due in April, strengthen the information systems area. Welcome folks!\n\nThe journal's publication schedule will also be changing, partly to bring the volume year into line with the calendar year and partly to avoid holiday periods as far as possible. So, this year, the final two issues of Volume 12 will be published in April and October and Volume 13 will have its four issues in March, June, September and December of 2008, with subsequent volumes having the same publication pattern. This way, I might actually have some holiday time at Christmas!\n\nGiven how far the month is advanced, it may seem a little late, but... a very Happy New Year!\n\nTom Wilson</div>

They have all tested their skills on one or two papers and have been a big help with this issue. Our long-term copy-editor, ~RaeAnn Hughes, has also re-surfaced after a long illness and will be back on the team for the next issue.\n\nAnd, while we are on volunteers, thanks to Elena Maceviciute for link-checking and to Pedro Dias and Jose Vicente Rodriguez for the Spanish abstracts.\n\nWe have also started using Open Journal Systems for all submissions and I hope that this will prevent the occasional item from slipping through the net and failing to be reviewed. It seems to be working well, with only one or two minor problems. If you wish to submit a paper, go to the site, register as an Author and then follow the instructions for submitting a paper. The general rules for the preparation of papers are on that site, as well as at the Instructions for Authors location.\n\n''@@bgcolor(#ff0000):color(#ffffff):In this issue@@''\n\nThis issue is an almost 50:50 split between papers on activity theory for the thematic issue and those on a variety of topics, which have been submitted in the normal way. The activity theory papers are the subject of another editorial by Guest Editor, Dr. Mark Spasser, so I shall refrain from comment here, except to that Mark for his work on behalf of the journal and also to remark upon one of the items, which is not a paper, but a full-length bookâ€”a first for the journal.\n\nThe book, Human activity, by Benny Karpatschof, is not seeing its first publication; it was published originally, in a small edition, by the Dansk Psykologisk Forlag and its publication here was suggested by Prof. Birger HÃ¸rland of the Royal School in Copenhagen and Birger also provides a review of the book in our book review section. The book was provided as a set of .pdf files and, apart from the top page, they remain in that form since conversion to xhtml would be a major task.\n\nThe 'non-thematic' papers in the issue cover a wide range of topics, as usual: one is in Portuguese (our first in this language) and one is in Spanish. The Portuguese paper deals with stemming algorithms for the Portuguese language and comes from Brazil. The authors conclude that Portuguese has not had a great deal of attention from this point of view and, perhaps, needs further algorithms to be developed. The Spanish paper is on information literacy in public libraries; this is a somewhat under-developed area and the authors argue that information literacy programmes in public libraries should be a priority if life-long learning is to be a reality.\n\nThe English language papers are equally diverse, covering factors that affect the implementation of information technology in the financial services industry; the dynamics of community network development in the north-east USA, and the information seeking behaviour of Jewish scholars in Israeli universities.\n\nThe Reviews section includes a review of the second edition of Donald Case's now standard work on Looking for information, now covering more than 1,000 sources on the subject of information seeking behaviour, as well as reviews of a wide range of books of interest to the 'information' field. We also have a review of a piece of Web-ware (again, a first for the journal), ~TiddlyWiki, which is a very easy to use tool, requiring the download of only a single Web page, which then serves as the template for your own wiki. I've used this to create a database of the abstracts and editorials in the current volume of the journal as a demo of what can be done.\n\nAs announced in the last issue, we now have a longish pause before the final issue of Volume 12 in October, with the first issue of Volume 13 coming in March, 2008.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProfessor Tom Wilson, Publisher/~Editor-in-Chief\nApril 2007\n</div>

The response to crisis situations of media documentation centres is analysed in relation to the terrorist attack on Madrid on 11 March, 2004. The goal of this presentation is to assess the impact of the event on the Documentation Centres of the media.\n//''Methodology''//. Interviews were carried out in the Documentation Centres using a schedule of open questions previously defined by the people in charge of the documentation services of three main Spanish newspapers: El Pais, El Mundo and Abc. The interviews were supplemented by the analysis of the news published around the date of the attack, and those which were published a year later in some special editions.\n//''Results''//. The main consequences for the Documentation Centres were: an increase in the number of queries, and a conscientious search for potentially useful sources. Work methods became closer to editorial tasks and documentary tasks were changed, including saving national and international news on the event, the production of chronologies and some audio-visual materials. The third consequence was the development of information products such as data bases, compilation documents and graphics). These changes were accompanied by the development of a taxonomy of terrorism and similar topics.\n//''Conclusions''//. At crisis periods, the mass media have to adapt their work routines to the circumstances and facts imposed by new situations, although it alters their normal daily tasks.</div>

The activities of both system designers and end-users are mediated by historical practices and by the affordances of the available tools. Accessibility of user-created content may be limited by the ambiguous role of end-user designers, by the invisible impact of inaccessible designs and by the lack of appropriate tools to support end-user accessible design practices. \n''//Conclusions//''. Accessibility of social software systems depends on the cooperative work of system designers and end-users.

<div tiddler="Guest Editorial" modifier="Tom Wilson" modified="200704101335" created="200704091853" tags="">''@@bgcolor(#ff0000):color(#ffffff):Introduction@@''\n\nActivity Theory is a philosophical framework for studying different forms of praxis as developmental processes, with both individual and social levels interlinked. Activity theory allows us to study and historically situate praxis in relation to the material conditions shared by a group of people. Accordingly, it places cognition not in the head or 'inside the skin,' but in the relations that constitute the continuous flow of activity in which human activity is embedded. As such, the general philosophy of AT is the integration of the objective, the sociocultural, and the ecological (Spasser 1999).\n\nActivity theory has its origins in post-World War I Soviet Union as part of the cultural-historical school of psychology founded by Vygotsky, Leont'ev, and Luria (for historical reviews, see Axel 1997; Wertsch 1981). Activity theory has undergone continual development and today not only emphasizes the centrality of practice as doing and mediated action, but also brings to the fore setting and context as essential orienting concepts (see, especially, EngestrÃ¶m 1987; Nardi 1996). It arose in response to the exigent need to enlarge the research object of IS development, i.e., to take better account of contextuality - human activity is always situated in a context (or, more usually, intersecting contexts), and is impossible to understand outside of, or separate from, its contextual conditioning.\n\nBecause activities are always situated in specific contexts and are impossible to understand in isolation, a minimal meaningful context for individual actions must be included in the basic unit of analysis. Activity theorists call this basic unit an activity (or an activity system), which is at once more tractable than a social system, better defined and more persistent than arbitrary (and often ephemerally constructed) individual actions, and more meaningful than the artificial settings constructed for formal experimentation.\n\nAccording to Blackler (1995), human activity has five basic characteristics: 1) pragmatic, or directed toward an object, either material or ideal; 2) mediated by artifacts (in which social knowledge, praxis, and the mediating characteristics of an activity are inscribed and transmitted); 3) embedded and realized socially in a culture; 4) provisional, or historically developing and evolving; and 5) contested, emphasizing the prevalence of contradiction, incoherence, and dilemma as primary opportunities for individual and collective learning. Finally, a sixth characteristic of activity is its hierarchical organization, such that motivated activities are realized through chains of goal-oriented actions, which are carried out through conditions-contingent operations (Kuutti 1996).\n\nBy explicitly recognizing and theorizing three broad classes of complexity - the stratified nature of the social world, the social contextualization and embeddedness of interaction, and the dynamism of development (Kuutti 1996) - activity theory is a promising new direction for the field of information science research. Conceptually, the theory registers the shift of focus from the interaction between the isolated user and the stand-alone computer to a larger, more ecologically valid interaction context between human beings with their environment; sensitizes us to the dynamic and evolving nature of human-computer interaction and of information system design and evaluation; and highlights the rich, multi-faceted, and multi-dimensional reality of computer-mediated activity in situ (Nardi 1996). Methodologically, activity theory highlights the importance of specifying a research time-frame long enough to truly understand users' objectives and behaviour; studying broad, sufficiently contextualized patterns of behaviour; employing a varied, yet flexibly disciplined, set of data collection and analytic techniques whose selection is driven by the research question of interest; and understanding events, artifacts, and activity from users' points of view (Nardi 1996). Finally, activity theory can provide information science with a rich, unifying, and heuristically valuable vocabulary and conceptual framework that will facilitate both the continual betterment of practice and the secure transferability and accumulation of knowledge.\n\nThis special issue of Information Research presents recent research on activity theory in information studies. While widely used in education, human-computer interaction, and computer-supported cooperative work, activity theory has been more recently applied in information management, information science, and librarianship (see, e.g., HjÃ¸rland 1997). This special issue presents activity theoretic work on information behaviour in safety critical operations, information sharing and organizational knowledge production, information systems development, and Web design accessibility. Included is a book-length treatment of activity theory as a unifying and over-arching meta-theoretical framework for interconnecting the anthropological sciences.\n\n''@@bgcolor(#ff0000):color(#ffffff):Studying distributed information behaviour in safety critical operations@@''\n\nIn her paper, von Thaden draws upon concepts from Information Science, Human Factors, and Activity Theory to construct a framework for studying the interactions of discourse, social influence, and activity on safety critical operations in aviation. In particular, the author uses those theoretical influences to develop the Distributed Information Behaviour System to help explain the complicated, negotiated information behaviour of pilots, who must improvise procedural responses in ambiguous circumstances.\n\n''@@bgcolor(#ff0000):color(#ffffff):Information sharing and organizational knowledge production@@''\n\nIn their paper, ~WidÃ©n-Wulff and Devenport use activity theory to explicate the link between information sharing and organizational knowledge production in two very different Finnish firms - an insurance company and a small entrepreneurial high technology dental products company. The authors articulate the ways that individual and group information behaviours intersect with organizational processes and, in the process, contribute to the evaluation of activity theory as analytic framework for studying information behaviour in organizations. \n\n''@@bgcolor(#ff0000):color(#ffffff):Using activity theory as theoretical underpinning for information systems research and practice@@''\n\nIn their paper, Mursu, Minkkinen, and Korpela, use activity theory to create an analytic model - Activity Centred Design Model - that is, at once, work-oriented, practicable, emancipatory, and operational in information systems development. The Activity Centred Design Model, which is based on the Activity Analysis and Development Framework (~ActAD), contributes to an integrated multilevel analysis - individual, group/activity, organization, and global - of work behaviour. The authors study actions, operations, informational tool use, and human-tool interaction at the individual level; work processes and information flows at the group and activity level; activity networks and organizational boundaries at the organizational level; and legislation and national strategies at the societal level. Their model is necessarily two-dimensional, accounting for both the stratified nature of information system development and its evolution over time. Accordingly, each phase-level intersection can be analysed in terms of objective, emergent tools, and methods to achieve appropriate outcomes.\n\n''@@bgcolor(#ff0000):color(#ffffff):Modeling the activities of non-professional, end-user Web designers@@''\n\nIn his paper, Kane proposes an activity theoretic model of the activities of lay, end-user Web designers to holistically understand the production and increasing accessibility of user-produced Web content. He examines the implications of the activities of end-user designers and tool designers on disabled Website consumers. Barriers to the adoption of accessibility practices occur within and between activity systems. Perhaps, most interestingly, issues of content accessibility and the barriers to it can only be addressed collaboratively between the designer and consumer. The author reminds us that design is always situated, that accessibility design education requires an activity-level focus, that all actors (and their behaviour) must be considered within the contexts of their activity systems, and that tools, including information tools, mediate all human behaviour and must be designed accordingly.\n\n''@@bgcolor(#ff0000):color(#ffffff):Anthropological sciences from the perspective of Activity Theory@@''\n\nIn his book, Karpatschof takes on the difficult task of establishing the interconnection among the anthropological sciences whose common ground is determined to be human activity. The author examines the scope of human activity as the central concept of anthropology. In fact, from a meta-theoretical perspective, all quests for knowledge must be contextualized in human activity. The book is organized into three parts. The Prologue introduces activity theory. Part I, Foundation of activity theory, contains chapters on the ontology and conception of evolution in activity theory, and on the anthropology of human activity. Part II, Theory of knowledge, is comprised of chapters on the epistemology of activity theory, on the meaning and semiotics of activity theory, and meta-science from the perspective of activity theory. The author takes a Marxist approach to human activity, clearly acknowledging the materialist and pragmatist origins of activity theory.\n\n''@@bgcolor(#ff0000):color(#ffffff):Acknowledgements@@''\n\nI would like to gratefully thank ~Editor-in-Chief, Tom Wilson, for his support and, more specifically, for his help in preparing this special issue.\n\n''@@bgcolor(#ff0000):color(#ffffff):References@@''\n\nAxel, E.

Morey: Health Sciences Library, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York USA\n\n''Abstract''\n\n    //''Introduction''//. The purpose of this study is to explore the health information seeking behaviour of ~African-Americans using Granovetter's strength of weak ties as the theoretical framework.\n    //''Method''//. A listed household telephone survey of 216 residents who reside on the Near East Side ofBuffalo, New York. Using the Rand() feature in MS Excel a random sample was drawn from the telephone numbers randomly selected from census tracts covering the target area. Random samples were drawn three times until at least 200 telephone surveys were completed.\n    //''Analysis''//. Data analysis was completed using SPSS 13.0 for Windows. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed along with analysing descriptive statistics and the chi-squared test to determine the association between the source of health information as related to demographics and tie strength between individuals.\n    //''Results''//. Overall, most respondents rely on a health service professional for health information followed by a web site. Respondents reported having a 'somewhat close' relationship with health care professionals as compared to having a 'very close' relationship with family members. The importance of health service professionals as a significant or weak tie in health information seeking is consistent with the strength of weak ties theory. Results on proxy searching behaviour or searching on behalf of another person are also examined. Most respondents sought information for themselves, although 22.2 percent sought health information on behalf of another person.\n    //''Conclusions''//. These findings confirm the important role of health service professionals in health information seeking by under-served populations and suggest the need for investigation on the information giving behaviour of these professionals. These findings also demonstrate the need for further research on strong ties or close family and friends as a source of health information, in particular their role in proxy health information behaviour.\n\n</div>

A questionnaire was used to collect information on the subjects, their work responsibilities and characteristics of their workstations. Data on file and folder names and file structure were extracted from the hard disk using a computer program STG FolderPrint Plus, DOS command and screen capture.

The subjects organized their folders in a variety of structures, from broad and shallow to narrow and deep hierarchies. One to three levels of folders is common. The labels for first level folders tended to be task-based or project-based. Most subjects located files by browsing the folder structure, with searching used as a last resort. The most common types of folder names were document type, organizational function/structure, and miscellaneous/temporary.

After an investigation of the philosophical foundation of Activity Theory the book undertakes an assessment of the adequacy of this theory as a framework for the anthropological sciences. The thesis is that the perspective of Human Activity is a key to solving basic problems found in epistemology, anthropology, sociology, psychology, semiotics and even in the study of science itself. \n''//Definition//'' Human Activity is defined as a mediated form of activity, and has Tools, Signs, Cooperation and Appropriation as its prime mediators. Each of the six chapters of the book provides a specific perspective on the general subject, Human Activity and on the general theory, Activity Theory.\n''//Outline//'' The first chapter introduces the historical background of Activity Theory including the evolution of the theory from Hegel to Marx and the two Russian psychologists Vygotsky and Leont'ev. Ch. 2 covers the basic problems of ontology and evolution; the ontology assumes an original cosmological object field, from which a biological field emerged, and from the latter an anthropological object field emerged. Ch. 3 analyses the relation between pre-human activity, belonging to the biological object field, and humnn activity, belonging to the anthropological field, the characteristics of which are discussed. In Ch. 4, epistemology is discussed from the perspective of human activity. Ch. 5 attempts to clarify the problem of meaning, and in this connection the leading theories in semiotics and language theory are discussed. Finally, Ch.6 is dedicated to the study of science that is, the discipline of Metascience. Themes treated in this chapter indude: the relation between technological and scientific evolution, the status of the formal sciences and the difference between the natural and the anthropological sciences, in particular, psychology.</div>

It is the first case study of a making and tinkering (or craft) hobby, gourmet cooking. The central activity of the hobby is described and serves as a context to relate and locate information activities and information resources.\n    ''//Method.//'' In this scientific ethnography, twenty gourmet cooks from Boston and Los Angeles, USA were interviewed in their residences about their pursuit of the hobby and its associated information phenomena. Then, domestic culinary information resources and spaces were documented through a photographic inventory.\n    ''//Analysis.//'' Interview transcripts and field notes were studied for themes through an iterative process of inductive and deductive analysis. A visual analysis process was performed on the photographs.\n    ''//Results.//'' Hands-on cooking takes the form of a nine step episode. Information activities and resources are instrumental, interwoven, and varied across the process. In any cooking episode use and re-use are the prevailing information activities; the hobbyist is an active producer and manager of information; and the recipe is a primary document.\n    ''//Conclusion.//'' The study demonstrates how to explicate and conceptualize information phenomena in serious leisure, and sets up lines of inquiry to explore in future research.</div>

We discuss the concept of core competencies applied to policies for teaching and training information professionals, particularly librarians.\n    //''Method''//. Sixty graduates of the Institute were employed as information professionals. These sixty were asked to attribute degrees of importance to specific items associated with knowledge and skills that, within the scope of this research, were considered core competencies for meeting the demands of their jobs. Participants were also asked to cite knowledge they acquired in school and knowledge they use in exercising their profession, the skills that they consider necessary but that they did not gain in school, and the difficulties they encounter in exercising their profession and for which they were not sufficiently well prepared.\n    //''Analysis''//. Both quantitative and qualitative data analyses were performed. The data were tabulated using Access and several reports and cross-tabulations were generated.\n    //''Results''//. The results suggest a gulf between knowledge and skills acquired in library school and those that are required by the job market. In particular, participants lacked the skills they needed to work with information and communication technologies.\n    //''Conclusion''//. The concept of core competencies is increasingly taken into account by the productive sector of the economy. The educational system ought to keep up with this change. The empirical research described shows that there is a need to establish advanced and modern policies for the education of librarians, participants in the market for information professionals. \n\n</div>

Organizations seek and use information to understand and enact their worlds. Information constitutes what the organization 'knows' about its environment and its tasks, and thus creates a basis for action. However, the link between information, knowledge, and action is problematic and not well understood.\n     //''Method''//. We consider three case studies that highlight different aspects of the interaction between information and knowledge in organizations. The first case compares information seeking and use in the due diligence processes of a government agency and a venture capital firm. The second case surfaces the epistemic properties of information seeking in the preparation of country studies by the staff of a German bank. The third case recollects the experience of large-scale information sharing among copier technicians of a multinational office products company.\n     //''Analysis''//. These case studies suggest that organizations behave as epistemic communities with distinct epistemic and information cultures that influence how information is sought and utilized, and how beliefs are formed and re-formed.\n     //''Conclusions''//. To understand information behaviour in organizations is to understand how organizations are simultaneously information-seeking and belief-forming social systems, where information is shaped by epistemic practices as much as beliefs are the outcomes of information seeking and use.\n\n</div>

This paper is the first report of a research project on the effects of information service to business in Japanese public libraries. The overall goals of the project are to develop a conceptual framework for understanding effects of a library service and then to examine them in business information service. The objective of this first report is to get an overview of current practice of business information service in Japanese public libraries and examine images of users and uses by librarians in charge.\n    //''Method''//. The project consists of three stages. At the first stage a series of field trips was conducted with semi-structured interviews in twenty-two libraries throughout Japan and a focus group interview of librarians in charge of the service was also conducted (not reported here).\n    //''Results''//. A variety of services is provided by public libraries. Levels of reference service and relationships with other agencies and organizations are the most important factors in determining the nature and kind of service provided. Providing the service is actually a complex process influenced by many factors.\n    //''Conclusions''//. Results suggest strongly the complex process of value creation. Images of users and uses are formed not only by direct contact with users but as a result of this complex process. Sometimes images have political connotations as both librarians and other stakeholders hope the service to be useful in promoting local business and/or industry and advancing local lives. \n\n</div>

This descriptive research attempted to investigate the information seeking behaviour of engineers at Khuzestan ~Sugar-Cane and ~By-Product Company in Iran.\n    //''Method''//. To collect the data, a questionnaire was distributed using Likert-type questions with six points ranging from 'never use' to 'very useful'.

Analysis of variance and the Tukey test were used to test the sole hypothesis of the research and to see if engineers who worked in various sites were different in their information-seeking behaviour. To answer the research questions, descriptive statistics were employed.\n    //''Results''//. The results showed that the engineers in different work areas were significantly different in terms of information-seeking behaviour. The most important motivations for seeking information were: to develop their knowledge and expertise; to be able to use new job-related technologies and to be up-to-date in their specialty.\n    //''Conclusions''//.

<div tiddler="Open access publishing" modifier="Tom Wilson" modified="200704211932" created="200704092214" tags="">Open Access publishing is receiving a great deal of publicity as I write, with the commercial publishers beginning a fight-back by hiring a major public relations adviser.  They are worried, of course, at the thought that by allowing authors to archive their publications for open access, they may be cutting their own throats.  And that could be true: although, since it refers to some uncertain future, it's a hypothetical situation.\n\nOpen Access as currently understood has three modes: 1) open archiving of papers published in subscription journals - a move that requires at least the acquiescence of publishers, if not their whole-hearted enthusiasm.  This mode is described by devotees of OA as the 'Green Route' to open access; 2)  making openly available the content of subscription journals by charging authors (or their research funders or their institutions) for the publication of papers - this is described as the 'Gold Route'; 3) the true Gold Route (or perhaps we should call it the 'Platinum Route') of collaborative, subsidised publication of open access journals which make no author charges and charge no subscription fees.  Subscription charges are a barrier to access; author charging is a barrier to publication - the only way to achieve true Open Access (TOA), is through mode 3 - Information Research is published under this model, with the main support coming from the Editor and Publisher, aided by the University of Lund Libraries and the Swedish School of Library and Information Science.\n\nTOA (the Platinum Route) is readily achievable for niche subjects, as the publishers of the more than 800 journals using the Open Journal Systems journal management software can testify, since such areas have manageable rates of submission of papers, and publish only a small number of those submitted.  It would be more problematic for subject areas that have hundreds or even thousands of submissions every year, but still, I believe, achievable.  The mode of operation is similar for big and small fields:  use journal management software, have several sub-editors for different areas of the field, or for submissions from different parts of the world, run a common list of referees for all editors to draw upon and recruit as many copy-editors and proof-readers as are needed to run the operation.\n\nUsing this model, Information Research now has four regional editors (and I am looking for a fifth), one of whom doubles as Book Reviews Editor and three copy-editors/proof-readers and the whole throughput of submissions (although not yet the publishing routine) is run on Open Journal Systems.\n\nWhat is the motivation? you may ask. Why should I get involved?  The answer depends upon your interest in scholarly communication.  If you believe that research ought to be openly available, partly to ensure that what you produce is actually read by as many people as possible, which will benefit your citation rates, and, more importantly, to benefit society generally, then TOA is the only game in town.  If you are interested in publishing for its own sake, rather than for any personal or public benefit, being involved in a TOA journal will give you a great deal of experience about the publishing process.  If you are interested in the reported research, then you gain access to papers at an early stage of their life and can help the process by being a referee, a section editor or a copy-editor and proof-reader: all of these are valuable roles in the publishing process.\n \nIf you have views on OA and, particularly, on TOA, or if you have questions on the practicalities of TOA, let me know: wilsontd @ gmail . com - you know how to make this a proper e-mail address!\n\nInformation Research is running a series of case studies on Open Access publishing: the first two studies are now available, dealing with [[The Electronic Journal of IT in Construction|http://informationr.net/ir/11-3/paper255.html]] and [[Medical Education Online]].\n\n</div>

In this work, we have used transaction logs from the Excite search engine to develop methods for analysing query transformations that should aid the analysis of our ongoing experimental work.

Reinhard: //School of Communication, Ohio State University, 154 N. Oval Mall, Columbus, Ohio, USA, 43210//\n\n''@@bgcolor(#ff0000):color(#ffffff):Abstract@@''\n\n    Introduction. We report here on the research phase of a multi-stage dialogue examining convergences and divergences in how three fields (library and information science, human computer interaction and communication and media studies) looked at users and each other. Our focus was on what researchers and practitioners saw as the big unanswered questions in user studies and what they saw as the convergences and divergences across disciplinary and practice-research divides.\n    Method. Eighty-three international experts in the three fields were interviewed by phone; thirty-one local experts, public and academic librarians serving universities and colleges in central Ohio, were interviewed using self-journals and focus group reports.\n    Analysis. A thematic analysis was completed. The purpose was not to fix substantive differences but to identify ways in which convergences and divergences showed relevance to the communicative aspects of the research enterprise. A theory of dialogue was applied that purposively positioned this analysis as only one of potentially many.\n    Results. All informants showed strong commitment to improving user studies and making them matter more to design, practice and society. At the same time, regardless of field or perspective, they struggled with the incoherencies of avalanches of user research. They decried the general inability to communicate across fields and between research and practice. They decried the ways in which structural conditions seemed to constrain possibilities. Yet, they hoped for better things to come.\n    Conclusions. The traditional modes used for communication in the social science research enterprise are not doing the job for user studies. We need to reclaim some procedures lost in the current emphases on quantity over quality and invent other options. This is the theme of our second paper, in this same issue. \n</div>

This is a working paper which aims to present the preliminary results of a study into the search behaviours of the general public. The paper reports on the findings of the first six months of an eighteen-month data collection excercise.\n    //''Methods''//. Detailed observations were made of nine volunteers, engaged on a variety of search tasks. Some of the tasks were self-selected, others were set by the researchers. Most tasks however, were designed to enable the volunteers to search within their own areas of interest and expertise.\n    //''Analyses''//. A set of 'search dimensions' is proposed and qualitative findings based on these are presented. In addition, some initial quantitative findings are discussed.\n    //''Results''//. Findings to date suggest that the best search strategy is a combination of simplicity and scrutiny. Volunteers who entered a few search terms but then carefully studied the results, appeared to be more successful than those who attempted to be prescriptive and entered a long series of terms. </div>

Fisher, Carol F. Landry and Charles Naumer\nThe Information School, University of Washington Box 352840, Seattle, Washington, USA\n\n@@color(maroon):''Abstract''@@\n\n    //''Introduction''//. In the late 1990s Fisher (writing as Pettigrew) proposed 'information grounds' to describe social settings in which people share everyday information while attending to a focal activity.\n    //''Method''//. This study was conducted at a major research university, home to 45,000 students. Data were collected by seventy-two Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) students as part of an information behaviour class. Trained in interviewing techniques, each MLIS student interviewed ten students in public places, including the campus and the university commercial district. The survey, comprising twenty-seven primarily open-ended questions, was conducted from October 14-21, 2004. Data were collected from 729 college students and entered, along with extensive field notes, into an in-house Web form.\n    //''Analysis''//. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were supplemented by mini-reports prepared by the student researchers along with full-team debriefings.\n    //''Results''//. Using a people, place and information-related trichotomy, characteristics are discussed in terms of how they can be manipulated to optimize information flow in social settings.\n    //''Conclusions''//. By understanding better the characteristics of 'information grounds' and the interactions among these characteristics, we may be able to develop social spaces in support of information flow and human interaction. Our college student and other studies suggest that 'information grounds' play an intrinsic role in facilitating communication among people and that by building an in-depth 'information grounds' typology, beginning with basic categorical characteristics, we may develop new methods for facilitating information exchange. \n\n</div>

The Internet has radically changed the global availability of scholarly publications. Today, a substantial part of the resources accessible for researchers and university students are offered through electronic site licenses, making the supply of easily obtainable information larger than ever. This brings forth an important question: what are the qualitative and quantitative effects of this development on the use of reference material in research and studies?\n    //''Method''//. To address the research question, reference lists of Masters' theses from 1985, 1993 and 2003 were studied in three disciplines: economics, psychology and mathematics, followed by semi-structured interviews of students who had finished their thesis in 2003.\n    //''Analysis''//. The quantitative data were analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the statistical program SPSS, where the significance of the results was measured with Dunnet's t-test.\n    //''Results''//. The findings showed a substantial increase in the use of scholarly articles as references throughout the studied time periods, although the amount of other information sources had remained largely unchanged. There were also significant differences between the three disciplines in the contents of their reference lists, the amount of Internet resources that students used, how they sought and obtained publications, and how they selected their sources.\n    //''Conclusions''//. The Internet appears to have had a profound effect on the type and quantity of information that students use as references in Master's theses. One of the main problems that students reported was a lack of training in information seeking, and the abundance of irrelevant information on the Internet. Many respondents would have needed additional training on using library databases. \n\n</div>

Forty-five interviews were conducted over a period of three years.\n    ''//Analysis.//'' The IDOL project adopted a phenomenographic approach with the purpose of describing patterns of variation in experiences. The findings were also analysed by way of relating them to four competing approaches to the mediation of information literacy.\n    ''//Results.//'' A gap was identified between experiences of teaching content that focused on sources and order, and experiences of assessment criteria applied to students' work that focused on the importance of correct facts and the analysis of information. These findings indicate a highly restricted range of teaching contents when compared with the four theoretical approaches to the mediation of information literacy.\n    ''//Conclusion.//'' Teaching information seeking might be enhanced by a wider repertoire of contents reflecting more varied theoretical understandings developed in information seeking research, particularly as regards the importance of content and context related to user perspectives. </div>

The main objective is to judge whether timelines could, in principle, be automatically generated from contemporary debates. A secondary objective is to analyse the reasons for differences between contemporary debates and retrospective media timelines.\n    ''//Method.//'' Our method exploits the new opportunities for large-scale analysis afforded by electronic news feeds and blogs. We compared published media timelines with blog postings and news stories related to the London attacks of July, 2005. Rich Site Summary (RSS) technology was used to gather data from 19,587 blog and news sites. For the period of July 7 to July 31 we identified an average of 275 sources a day that posted new information containing the word 'London'. These postings, a combination of blogging and news stories, formed the raw data for our analysis. In particular, we extracted and counted the individual words used in the postings.\n    ''//Analysis.//'' We compared contemporary word usage statistics from our RSS data with the text of three published media timelines, particularly seeking words and types of words that were present in one but not the other.\n    ''//Results.//'' We found that the timelines tended to ignore the role of communication during the event itself, to use less emotionally charged language, and to gloss over to some extent the wider context of the event. Hence some aspects (frames) of the unfolding discussion were ignored by the timelines. Moreover, all sources included a range of relatively trivial details, the timelines apparently using them as concept markers (metonymy) for broader issues.\n    ''//Conclusions.//'' It seems that it would be difficult to automatically generate media timelines from contemporary discussions because of frame changes, and because of changes in terminology and the difficulty in separating highly discussed relatively insignificant details from the key facts. Nevertheless, the comparative analysis techniques reported in this paper may provide an interesting new window on contemporary discussions and media representations of major events. \n\n</div>

The explicit aim is to define a meaningful set of information system requirements. The report shows how dynamic situations may lead us to question a number of established theories of information science.\n    ''//Method.//'' Passenger information officers were observed on duty within the rail command and control headquarters. Observation sessions totally eight hours involved the manual recording of sequential information flows and the associated activity of the Officers. A semi-structured management interview was also conducted to provide further insight into the organizational context.\n    ''//Analysis.//'' A viewpoint-oriented analysis technique was used to analyse sequential data captured during observation sessions. Event sequences that represent and explain the viewpoints were identified and elaborated into detailed scenario descriptions.\n    ''//Results.//'' The analysis both supports and contests a number of established theories from information science. Additionally, a range of 'mandatory' and 'desirable' system requirements are derived from the scenario and viewpoint analyses.\n    ''//Conclusion.//'' Dynamic situations have a significant impact on information behaviour which is not always predicted by current theories of information science. </div>

When children are adjudicated by a court of law as being maltreated, they are summarily removed from their homes, resulting in a disruption of their daily lives. This pilot study examines the context in which maltreated children seek and use information to cope with this stressful period of their lives.\n    ''//Method//''. This study applies Taylor's four components of information use environments to look at the user and the uses of information and the contexts within which those users make choices about what information is useful to them at particular times.\n    ''//Analysis//''. The characteristics of foster children as a population are examined. The settings in which such children seek information are described and the problems the experience, which are linked to information seeking, are articulated as are the problem resolutions.\n    ''//Results//''. The most important finding of this study is that there are three clearly differentiated phases of information needs and seeking corresponding to the three phases of adjustment the children experience.\n    ''//Conclusion//''. Understanding problem phases underpinning everyday life contexts in foster care environments afford support personnel, who provide information to these children, better insights into what helps and what results in increasing anxiety or causes more trauma. </div>

Articles were coded for data collection and data analysis methods, the use of theory, and parts of the article (title, abstract, literature search, method, findings, discussion and conclusion) where participants were included. Also noted were terms used to label research participants, data collection practices and strategies used by authors to present users.\n    ''//Results//''. Authors use a variety of terms and data collection practices that construct the information user or research participant as both peripheral and central to research.\n    ''//Conclusion//''. Researchers must bring greater consciousness to the conduct and reporting of their research. Improvements are needed in doctoral training, research methods texts and publishers' instructions to authors. \n\n</div>

This study reports the application of Ellis's behavioural model to the information seeking behaviour of Jewish studies scholars.\n''//Method//''. A qualitative study in which twenty-five scholars from four universities in Israel were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide in which participants were encouraged to talk about different aspects of their information seeking behaviour.\n''//Analysis//''. Data were analysed using the grounded theory approach. This method consists of identifying incidents, events and activities and coding them into their respective categories by constantly comparing them to the properties of the emerging category to develop and saturate the category. \n''//Results//''. Findings point to a strong relationship between the information activities used and the stage of the research or purpose of the search. \n''//Conclusion//''. The proposed innovation positions of each of Ellis's information activities within a time frame or relating them to a specific type of scholarly activity. The proposed revision gives a comprehensive view of the active stages of the information seeking process through the information activities used at each research phase. \n</div>

One of the many strategies for processing texts for the indexing of their contents in information retrieval systems is called stemming, which consists in the reduction of similar words to the same unvarying representation. Stemming relies on the morphological structure of the language with which it is intended to work. \n''//Aim//''. This paper aims at defining the concept of stemming, presenting the algorithms available for Portuguese and commenting on several topics related to the use of this type of algorithms. \n''//Method//''. Literature review on stemming for Portuguese known to the authors. \n''//Results//''. To this day, there are only three algorithms published which deal with stemming in Portuguese: Porter's, Orengo's and Gonzalez's.\n''//Conclusion//''. Today,improvement in terms of stemming for the Portuguese language cannot be achieved successfully, since there is little research being done in this area. </div>

Layered transcriptions of document-by-document discussions, conversations and interviews with informants were analysed for evidence of uncertainty in informants' processes of discovery, evaluation, use and generation of information.\n    ''//Analysis.//'' Three themes are discussed illustrating the dynamic interplay between positive and negative forms of uncertainty: partial relevance, boundaries of understanding and uncertainty tolerance.\n    ''//Results.//'' The uncertainty experienced by informants takes many forms deeply embedded in the interwoven layers of information seeking and use. Positive forms of uncertainty were often, but not exclusively, associated with the informants' explorations within the wider research tasks in which they were engaged.\n    ''//Conclusion.//'' The intricacy of the relationship between what we might consider desirable as opposed to undesirable uncertainty is not easily unravelled. From the searcher's perspective, the interplay between positive and negative forms may be one way of explaining their ability to tolerate challenging encounters within their information and research processes.</div>

By sorting user types it was found out that women tended to manifest a pragmatic way of information use (the S type). Men confirmed analytic information processing (the A type). Women declared less experience in the use of electronic resources and publishing. Differences in orientation, collaboration and feelings have been noted.\n    ''//Conclusion.//'' Gender as a variable can be productive for better understanding of cognitive and social background of human information processing.

Brooks: //University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA//\n\n''@@bgcolor(#ff0000):color(#ffffff):Introduction@@''\n\nA little history first: Today's Web browsers trace their lineage back to the 1990s browser wars when major Web players attempted to dominate the Web by building browsers with idiosyncratic implementations of ~JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets, the Document Object Model, etc. One unintended consequence was the increase in complexity of cross-browser scripting. It was tough to build a fancy Web page when different browsers (and different versions of the same browser) broke your Web page. Interesting background reading: &quot;Internet Explorer vs. the standards&quot;.\n\nAs we leave the age of DHTML behind us, cast a glance back at perhaps the last and best DHTML book: DHTML utopia: modern Web design using ~JavaScript & DOM by Stuart Langridge. Note how Langridge has to develop hacks to deal with cross-browser issues such as memory leaks and closures. Most people who create Web content don't want to tangle with these subtleties. Hence the utility of ~JavaScript libraries (i.e., YUI) written by experts that hide all the ugly cross-browser details so the rest of us can concentrate on our Web content.\n\nConceptual fork: Note that there are two topics here. One is making a server call for new content. Then with the new content in hand, you need to reach down into the HTML structure of your Web page (i.e., its DOM - Document Object Model) and add/change/delete/modify, etc. Ajax libraries cover both of these. The first is relatively simple, but the second is much more messy. Can you imagine writing ~JavaScript code to create a slider object that works on ~PCs and Macs, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, etc. Tricky!</div>
