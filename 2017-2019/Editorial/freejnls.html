Although BETA started out as a great proponent of the new information technologies that are wending their way through the world, reservations have emerged, questions posed, worries aired.

I am a gadget freak on the one hand, yet for some reason I refuse to buy a mobile phone even as I poll my answering machine fifteen times a day. I love the Web, yet I find that my obsession with it sometimes gets the better of me. Each month, along with the book reviews and the cartoons generously contributed by BETA people, I try to portray how in many obvious and strange ways, the new information world is evolving."</blockquote>
