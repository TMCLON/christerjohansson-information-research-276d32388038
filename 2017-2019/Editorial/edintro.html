<h1>Electronic Dissertations</h1>

<p>This new section of <b><i>Information Research</i></b> includes three dissertations from the Department of Information Studies at the University of Sheffield, which were undertaken by students as part of an experiment in the preparation of electronic dissertations.  Discussions are on-going in the Department on the lessons learnt from this exercise, with a view to increasing the number of dissertations that will be made available in this form.</p>

<p>The <a href="mailto:t.d.wilson@shef.ac.uk">Editor</a> will be interested to hear from any other academic departments in the field that would be interested in having links to their own electronic dissertations placed in this section.</p>
