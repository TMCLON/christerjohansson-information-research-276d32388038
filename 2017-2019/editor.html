<p>For this issue we have produced a version of <i>Information Research </i>that uses the 'frames' facility of <i>Netscape Version 2.0</i>.   This allows us to use the contents list as a banner, with the individual papers displayed on the main frame of the browser window.   The non-frames version remains available for those whose browser does not accommodate frames.

<p>The three papers in this issue show the diversity of activity in the Department of Information Studies, ranging as they do from an educational development programme (supported by the European Community) to a consideration of Total Quality Management issues in academic libraries.

<p>The TRAIN-ISS initiative of the European Commission (DGXIII) aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of a postgraduate level, Europe-wide, training programme in Electronic Information Management.   The contract to deliver the course was won by the Department in association with the Instituto Nacional de Engenharia e Tecnologia Industrial in Lisbon (which had been associated with the Department for a number of years)

<p>Following a pilot project, Brendan Loughridge and Tom Wilson, obtained a British Library R & D Department Grant to investigate the management information needs of academic heads of departments using a critical success factors approach.  This paper is an introduction to the project and a preliminary account of its methods.

<p>Finally, the Total Quality Management paper results from Ph.D. studentship, provided by the Department for Enducation and Employment, and relates to Bob Usherwood's long-standing interest in the field.
