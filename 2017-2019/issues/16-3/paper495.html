    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The generation born between 1982 and 2000 has been identified as the
      Millennial generation (Strauss and Howe 1991, Howe and Strauss 2000).
      They have come of age in a digital world with ubiquitous information
      sources. The libraries with their strong mediated search support are no
      longer the primary sources of information for them. Consequently,
      existing information behaviour models may not adequately describe their
      approach to filling information needs. The goal of this research was to
      explore the information search behaviour of this generation in relation
      to commonly cited information search behaviour models. 
    </p>
    <p>The longitudinal study detailed in this paper evaluated the search
      behaviour of Millennial generation students conducting information
      searches in a naturalistic environment. In the study participants
      provided detailed information on their search choices and judgments of
      document relevance over a five week period. The findings based on these
      empirical results provide some indication of how members of the
      Millennial generation progress through a search process. The subjects
      in this study proceeded erratically through their search process and
      did not appear to validate sources or information gathered. 
    </p>
    <p>Information search process models provide a framework for the study
      and evaluation of information searches. Models such as Kuhlthau's
      (1993), Ellis's (1989) and Wilson's (1999) provide some guidance on the
      search process but have limitations in their application. These models
      were developed prior to the widespread use of the Internet as an
      information resource. Ellis's subjects were adult professionals, not
      Millennial generation students. Kuhlthau's subjects were from a variety
      of age groups and may have included some young Millennial generation
      subjects, but the research was done before the availability of the
      Internet. 
    </p>
    <p>Research has provided little insight into how information behaviour
      differs on the Internet, specifically with the Millennial generation,
      and whether or not previously identified models are appropriate.
      Millennial generation users are more likely to search for information
      on the Internet using commercial search engines (Abram 2006; Oblinger
      2003). Research on how these searches are conducted could inform us on
      the current information behaviour of the Millennial generation. Results
      could provide the basis for improved information search process models
      which better reflect current technology and the generation of
      information seekers raised with this technology.
    </p>
    <h2>Literature review </h2>
    <p>In Generations Strauss and Howe (1991) present a broad historical
      panorama of generations and their influence on history. The authors
      identify the Millennial generation as those born in or after 1982. In
      Millennials Rising the authors identify the same start date for the
      generation and infer a cutoff date of 2000. The authors present
      theories concerning the influences of a generational cohort and the
      environment in which the cohort is raised and comes of age. The
      Millennial generation is a group raised during a boom period. This
      prosperity created significant social and technological shifts leading
      to a distinct cultural identity. 
    </p>
    <p>The Millennial generation is only familiar with a world where
      personal computers and information are easily accessible, and has
      distinct expectations concerning technology, communication, and access
      to information. Abram (2006) notes that Millennial generation students
      expect instant access to information (cell phones, portable computers,
      Internet access), and tend to procrastinate with research and the
      choices it requires. They tend to be multi-taskers, often doing several
      tasks at once. They exist in a noisy, media-driven world, a condition
      that may lead to issues with filtering what is valid and important to
      their task. Constant socializing in a connected world leads to
      persistent distractions from any assigned task (Essinger 2006).
      The prevailing educational view is that students in undergraduate
      programs have incomplete cognitive thinking skills. This creates
      difficulty in discerning valid information from invalid information. In
      a mediated search environment, a librarian would help the student
      identify valid information sources and provide guidance on how to
      identify valid and useful information. This mediation is lacking in an
      environment where the student searches the Web unaided (Wieler 2004). 
    </p>
    <p>Gross and Latham (2011) conducted an investigation of experiences
      and perceptions of information with first year college students,
      members of the Millennial generation. The researchers indicated that
      subjects viewed finding information as a product, not a process.
      Subjects in the study indicated that they did not perceive finding
      information as being difficult or requiring any particular skill set.
      One subject commented that "the computer does all the work for you
      basically". Subjects also felt the evaluation of information was
      subjective, not objective, suggesting a postmodernist view of
      information and knowledge in general. The focus on a search product and
      dismissal of a process for evaluating and verifying content by subjects
      is reflective of the Millennial generation's neoliberal social view
      (Howe and Strauss 2000) where production and efficiency are important,
      and what appears to be a consumerist approach to education is a side
      effect of this view. 
    </p>
    <p>In Rowlands et al. (2008), the search behaviour of a subset of the
      Millennial generation is examined in a broad, multi-method study.
      Researchers used a sample of those born after 1993, young members of
      the Millennial generation. They noted that searchers of this generation
      tended to search 'horizontally' rather than 'vertically',
      skimming content, viewing just one or two pages, and making quick
      relevance judgments based on this review. This thin, surface-level
      review of content is related to the lack of concern, or inability to
      discern, the authority of sources and the quality of content, as
      revealed in other studies of members of the Millennial generation
      (Williams and Rowlands 2007, Hirsh 1999, Grimes and Boening 2001,
      Lorenzen 2001). The familiarity and comfort with the Web as an
      information search conduit creates other problems. The hypertext
      interface that is the foundation of the Web creates a fragmented view
      of information. The Millennial generation is at ease in this
      environment, often not recognizing incomplete fragments as such. Each
      fragment of information appears to be as valid as any other. In
      Lorenzen (2001), subjects were clearly hesitant when asked how they
      evaluate the quality of a Website, some suggesting that a .com domain
      implied it was a reliable information source, and others indicating
      that a .com site was not a reliable source. Some subjects in the study
      felt that if a site was indexed by Yahoo! it had to be authoritative. 
    </p>
    <p>From a broader perspective, the culture within which the Millennial
      generation has learned cognitive skills may be partly to blame for
      these problems. Philosophers have identified the postmodern condition
      as a rejection of the objective, scientific evaluation of knowledge,
      and the general acceptance of a an open, subjective, uncritical view of
      knowledge. There is growing concern that members of the Millennial
      generation have adopted this uncritical view of information (Harley et
      al. 2001). Millennial generation information searchers appear to be
      more concerned with the time it takes to find and evaluate content than
      the overall validity or quality of that content, and generally prefer
      visual information to textual (Harley et al. 2001, Vondracek 2007,
      Wieler 2004).
      An additional cultural influence is the consumerist society within
      which the Millennial generation has been raised. In Harley et al.
      (2001), the postmodern condition as applied to the dissemination of
      information is considered a disruptive force in the growth and
      distribution of knowledge in our culture. Consumerism, superficiality
      and knowledge fragmentation are a result. In the information economy,
      information is just another economic commodity which is consumed at the
      lowest cost. The cost in this context is effort, and when seeking
      information, the Millennial generation individual often perceives the
      lowest cost as the most convenient, readily available information with
      limited consideration for quality (Buczynski 2005, Thompson 2003, Young
      and Von Segern 2001).
    </p>
    <h2>Information search process</h2>
    <p>How Millennial generation searchers work to fill their information
      need can be examined within the framework of an information search
      process model. Kuhlthau (1993, 1991) modelled information seeking as a
      series of stages. Her model was built on personal construct theory,
      Taylor's (1968) stages of need formation, Belkin et al.'s (1982)
      anomalous states of knowledge, and theories and models of expression
      and mood. Though developed in 1991, more current research continues to
      validate the basic tenets of the model (Kuhlthau et al. 2008).
      Kuhlthau's model is often interpreted as sequential, but the model does
      specifically allow backtracking and iteration. Ellis (1989, 1997)
      identified several search patterns used for gathering information to
      fulfil an information need. His model emphasized the subjective,
      iterative nature of the search process and avoids suggesting there is a
      consistent sequential process taking place. Wilson (1999) provided a
      synthesis and comparison of Ellis's and Kuhlthau's models which maps
      Ellis's model of search characteristics into Kuhlthau's stages.
    </p>
    <h2>Research questions</h2>
    <p>In order to better understand the information behaviour of the
      Millennial generation, this research tracked Millennial generation
      subjects as they progressed through a five week research project. The
      goal was to gather information to answer the broad question of how
      information seekers of the Millennial generation progress through the
      process of finding information. Specifically, do they proceed through
      an orderly search process, or is their behaviour somewhat erratic and
      symptomatic of procrastination? Do Millennial generation information
      seekers make some effort to discern the quality of documents reviewed
      on the Web, and if so, are they discerning throughout the search
      process? In general, is the search process used similar to previously
      identified search process models, or are there indications that their
      search behaviour has changed? These broad questions lead to the
      following specific research questions. 
    </p>
    <p>1. Do Millennial generation information seekers progress through a
      search process similar to that of Wilson's (1999) consolidated model,
      or is their search behaviour different?
    </p>
    <p>2. Do Millennial generation information seekers evaluate the quality
      of Web resources? Are they discerning about quality-related attributes
      of the sources retrieved from the Web? 
    </p>
    <p>3. How do Millennial generation information seekers make use of
      general information Websites such as Wikipedia? At what stage(s) in the
      search process are these pages used? 
    </p>
    <h2>Research design</h2>
    <p>The study involved the collection of data based on user searches.
      Users were Millennial generation students in an undergraduate business
      course. Subjects were given an assignment to create a presentation on a
      computer technology. The assignment was structured as a research report
      and subjects had to complete a bibliography of their sources. Most
      subjects had little knowledge of the research topic they were assigned.
      Data were collected on the results of each subject's information
      search. All searches were conducted on the Internet. Specifically
      information was collected on the document selected, the relevance
      judgment for the document (was the document relevant or not), the
      criteria used to judge document relevance, and the subject's stage in
      an information search process. 
    </p>
    <p>Data were collected using a Website with a modified search engine
      which executed searches using the Yahoo! search engine and then
      reformatted the results page to provide Web-based data collection for
      this study. Subjects were able to access this search engine interface
      over the Internet, thus allowing them to work in a naturalistic
      environment at their own pace. Subjects were not required to use the
      Website for searches, but they were required to use the Website to
      provide data on the results of their searches. Those who did not use
      the default search engine entered information on their sources using
      survey instruments identical to those used to enter the information
      from the default search engine. Approximately four source documents
      were entered by each individual using this mechanism. Almost all
      subjects chose to use the default search engine and almost all entries
      were entered using the survey instruments on those pages. It is worth
      noting that good sources of information could be found on the Web for
      the computer-related technical topics assigned to the subjects.
    </p>
    <p>Approximately 80 subjects were drawn from a convenience sample of
      junior and senior undergraduate students at an American university.
      Data were collected in 2007 and subjects were on average 19 through 22
      years of age, and were therefore born between 1985 and 1988, members of
      the Millennial generation. Subjects signed an informed consent form
      which explained the purpose of the research and that the information
      they provided would be treated anonymously.
      Subjects were allowed to choose a research topic from a list of topics
      (see Appendix D). Topics were all of the same approximate level of
      difficulty and were related to course content. Subjects were given
      several weeks to complete their research assignment and were required
      to complete specific interim assignments during that time period. A
      project abstract was due the first week, a detailed outline was due
      next, the rough draft of the presentation slides due the next week, and
      the final presentation slides were due the final week.
    </p>
    <p>Project data was collected anonymously using survey instruments
      integrated into the Web search engine interface (Appendix A). Subjects
      examined the documents returned from the search engine and then used
      the Website to indicate the relevance of the documents they examined
      (relevant, not relevant, partially relevant/not sure about relevance),
      their current stage in an information search process selected from a
      predetermined list of search stages, and the criteria used to make that
      relevance judgment selected from a predetermined list of relevance
      criteria (Appendices B and C). 
    </p>
    <p>The Website used for data collection contained detailed instructions
      on the use of the site and how to record the information required.
      Subjects were given instructions on the use of the Website and the
      meaning of the terms used on the site and help pages were provided to
      explain the search stage choices, relevance judgment choices, and
      criteria for relevance judgment choices used by the subjects. The
      Website captured data for each subject using an anonymous user ID for
      search stage choices, the document selected as a uniform resource
      locator (URL) and the relevance judgment.
    </p>
    <p>Data collected on the search stage provided an indication of how
      subjects were progressing through an information search process and
      enabled the evaluation of research question one. The relevance criteria
      related to quality of the document (accuracy, source quality, etc.)
      provided information for evaluation of research question two, and also
      provided some indication of how and when subjects were evaluating
      documents, data relevant to question one. Data collected on Websites
      visited (URLs) provided information for research question three. When
      these Websites were being visited, and the criteria used during each
      search stage also provided information about how subjects were
      progressing through the search process, data relevant to research
      question one. 
    </p>
    <h2>Search process, stage in task completion, and relevance criteria
      choices
    </h2>
    <p>The search stage model used for this research (see Table 1) was
      developed from the phases suggested by Wilson (1999) which synthesized
      the  Ellis's (1997) <em>characteristics</em> with the search process of
      Kuhlthau (1993). The list presented to the subjects is shown in
      Description Displayed to Subject column in Table 2. The term initiation
      was selected because it was considered clearer than beginning or
      starting. The term browsing was avoided because this term is now
      commonly used for all Web-related searching and would potentially be
      confusing to subjects. Instead, the term exploration was used to
      describe the process of scanning and gathering information. The
      remaining terms, differentiating, extracting and verifying are from
      Ellis (1997) and were used in lieu of Kuhlthau's terminology because
      they were considered more precise. The process of ending the search was
      considered to be implied by the submission of the final deliverable and
      would not have generated data relevant to the research questions; it
      therefore was not presented as a choice to the subjects.
    </p>
    <p>Table 3 contains
      the criteria
      identified by
      subjects as
      having some
      bearing on
      their relevance
      decision
      (relevant, not
      relevant, don't
      know/partially
      relevant), the
      decision whether
      or not
      the document
      (or Website)
      is relevant
      to their
      information need.
      The relevance
      criteria chosen
      by subjects
      were those
      factors that
      contributed to
      their relevance
      decision. Prior
      research by
      Barry (1994),
      Barry and
      Schamber (1998),
      and Cool
      et
      al.
      (1993) identified
      the criteria
      listed in
      Table 3. A
      number of
      studies have
      identified these
      criteria and
      have provided
      some confirmation
      as to
      their consistency
      across
      information
      retrieval tasks
      (Barry and
      Schamber 1998,
      Park 1993,
      Schamber 1991,
      Schamber and
      Bateman 1996, Xu
      and Chen
      2006). A subset
      of these
      criteria were
      presented to
      subjects not
      as specific
      criteria but
      using the
      contents of
      the Description
      Displayed to
      the Subject
      column in
      Table 3 (see
      Appendix C).
      Subjects were
      allowed to
      choose one
      or more
      criteria which
      they felt
      contributed to
      their relevance
      decision. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The criteria
      selected for
      this research
      are a
      subset of
      those identified
      in Table
      3. The reasons
      for these
      selections are
      as follows.
      The source
      column in
      Table 3
      identifies the
      source of
      the relevance
      criteria: Barry
      (1994), or Barry
      and Schamber
      (1998) , or Cool
      et al.
      (1993). To reduce
      the potential
      for confusion
      and survey
      exhaustion on
      the part
      of the
      subject, the
      number of
      relevance
      criteria
      presented to
      the subject
      was limited
      to fifteen.
      In addition to some criteria from the Cool study, criteria
      identified in the Barry
      (1994), and Barry
      and Schamber
      (1998) studies were
      used. Excluded
      were those
      criteria which
      were specific
      only to
      Schamber's
      (1991) earlier
      study and
      related to
      document
      qualities which
      were specific to
      her topic
      (weather reports)

    <p>The
      final deliverable was a ten to thirty slide PowerPoint presentation.
      Subjects were encouraged to go beyond general information sites (such
      as Wikipedia), and to use quality sources such as trade journals
      whenever possible. (Computer trade journal content is widely available
      on the Web.) Subjects were also encouraged to use between ten and
      twenty sources to prepare their presentation.

      Table 5 identifies the number of documents evaluated by subjects for

      evaluated varied significantly for each deliverable (&#967;2 = 98.9, df = 3,
      p-value &lt; .001). Subjects evaluated a total of 81 documents for the

      detailed project outline. This finding is not unexpected considering
      the subjects&#8217; instructions for the preparation of the report abstract
      were to create a brief explanation of the project and thus did not
      require a detailed knowledge of the topic. Table 5 also shows that

      <b>Table 6: Search stages reported by subjects</b>
    </p>
    <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="center" lang="en-GB">
      Table 7 and 8 identify the percentage of documents evaluated in each
      search stage. Table 7 lists percentages within search stage, and Table
      8 lists percentages within project deliverable. This provides some
      indication of how subjects proceed through the information search
      process. As subjects evaluated documents, they indicated which search
      stage they were in based on a list of search stage explanations (Table
      2). Expectations are that research done for preparation of the first
      deliverable, the project abstract, would be the initiation stage
      (identified as the 'initial search; start of the search process'). As
      Table 7 indicates, slightly less than half of the subjects indicated
      that they were in the initiation stage while preparing the project
      abstract. This finding indicates that over half the subjects reporting
      for the project abstract, the first deliverable, reported being in a
      search stage other than the initiation stage. <br>
    </p>
    <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="center" lang="en-GB">Table 8 provides another perspective on the initiation
      stage and the relationship between search stage and deliverable. As a
      percentage of documents evaluated within a search stage, during the
      preparation of the detailed outline, approximately 50% of the subjects
      reported being in the initiation stage, and they reported this after
      completing the project abstract, the first deliverable. Additionally,
      13% reported being in the initiation stage during the preparation of
      the rough draft, and 11% reported being in the initiation stage during
      the preparation of the final presentation. This indicates a non-serial
      progression through the information search process in relation to
      project deliverables. <br>
    </p>
    <p>As Table 7 indicates, only 16% of the subjects reported being in the
      verifying stage while preparing the final presentation deliverable.
      Subjects were more likely to identify extracting as their current
      search stage (defined as &#8216;extracting information to answer the
      question&#8217;) during this time frame. This indicates that these subjects
      were not concluding the search process in a manner consistent with
      Kuhlthau's information search process which has an expectation that the
      subject will perform some verification or evaluation of the research
      collected in the final stage.

    <h3>Evaluation of general information sites</h3>
    <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-GB">The
      selection of general information sites (defined in this study as the
      Wikipedia site) varied significantly in relation to project deliverable
      due (&#967;2 = 12, n=80, df = 3, P &lt; 0.01) as shown in Table 9. This site
      selection was approximately 10% of the total documents chosen overall
      (80 out of 758). Subjects were instructed to search beyond basic
      informational sites, and there were numerous sites available for their
      assigned topics. As Table 9 indicates, these sites were used
      consistently during the preparation of the abstract and rough draft,
      ranging between approximately 6% and 10% of the total sites chosen.
      There was a significant increase in the usage of these sites during the
      preparation of the final presentation. Table 10 provides additional
      insights into the use of these sites, showing a statistically
      significant relationship between the search stage and the selection of
      Wikipedia Web sites (&#967;2 = 15.7, df = 3, p-value &lt; 0.001). These
      results indicate that Wikipedia sites represent approximately 40 % of
      the of the sites evaluated when subjects reported being in the
      'extracting' stage (identified as "extracting information to answer the
      question").<br>

    <h3>Evaluation of criteria used to judge relevance</h3>
    <h3 class="western" lang="en-US">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">An
      examination of the criteria used by subjects to determine relevance
      provides some indication of their reasons for selecting or rejecting
      documents as they progressed through an information search process.
      Since there were a large number of criteria examined by the subjects,
      Table 11 is simplified to identify those criteria which changed most in
      terms of their selection as the subject moved through the search
      process. As this table indicates, subjects were more likely to select
      amount of information and depth as criteria in the earlier search
      stages (initiation and differentiating) than in later stages
      (initiation and verifying). The criteria of novelty of sources, the
      structure of the document, and time constraints of the subject was
      selected more in later stages. This may indicate that in later search
      stages the subjects are looking for new sources of information and
      possibly documents of different structure, providing a different
      approach and new information for their subject area. The criterion of
      time constraints was also more likely to be selected later in the
      process as deadlines loom. The criteria of  and depth were
      selected less later in the search process, when other criteria such as
      authority and structure were more likely to be selected. Though
      authority was selected more in later stages, the criterion of source
      quality was selected less, suggesting that based on the subjects'
      selections, subjects may not apply equal weight to authority and source
      quality as criteria. </span><br>

    </h3>
    <p>An examination
      of results
      grouped by
      deliverable
      required provides
      a slightly
      different
      perspective on
      the progress
      of the
      subjects, as
      shown in
      Table 12. This
      table examines
      criteria selected
      based on
      the date
      the subject
      made the
      evaluation. The
      date was
      then correlated
      with the
      deliverable due
      in that
      time frame.
      Based on
      this evaluation,
      subjects working
      on the
      final
      presentation,
      subjects who
      were approaching
      the end
      of their
      research effort,
      were more
      likely to
      select amount
      of
      information
      and
      understandability
      as criteria
      in their
      document choice.
      The accuracy,
      source
      quality,
      depth,
      and breadth,
      however, were
      less likely
      to be
      selected by
      these subjects.

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>In evaluating results in reference to research question one, these
      empirical results suggest that Millennial generation subjects do not
      proceed in an orderly fashion through an information search process.
      Though models such as Kuhlthau's (1993) did not predict a strictly
      linear progression through the information search process, it was
      implied that subjects would move through each of the various steps in
      the process. Subjects in this sample gathered documents consistently
      over the course of the assignment (see Table 5). Subjects should have
      acquired good knowledge of the topic by the time they completed their
      rough draft, but with this sample approximately 35% of the documents
      used were retrieved after the rough draft was completed, suggesting
      procrastination or backfilling (adding sources late in the research
      process as they finalize their report) on the part of subjects. A
      significant portion of subjects (67 %) reported being in fewer than
      four of the search stages studied (Table 6) also providing some
      indication that subjects may not be moving through a search process in
      an manner consistent with the search stages used in this study. 
    </p>
    <p>If subjects had made an orderly, pragmatic progression through an
      information search process, it would be expected that they report they
      were &#8216;verifying information gathered previously during the preparation
      of the final project deliverable. This search progression would be
      based on the expectation that subjects had gathered research
      previously, and were now examining and verifying that research as part
      of completing the final deliverable. The empirical evidence gathered
      with this subject pool suggests otherwise. The majority of subjects
      (53%) evaluating documents for the final presentation identified
      themselves as being in the extracting stage, described as &#8216;extracting
      information to answer the question&#8217;. Only 16% of subjects preparing the
      final deliverable identified themselves as being in the verifying
      stage. A closer examination of the verifying stage indicates that the
      selection of this stage as a percentage of the stages reported for a
      particular deliverable never exceeded 15% of the total (see Table 7),
      an indication that subjects were not &#8216;verifying information that has
      been gathered previously&#8217;. Most of the documents evaluated by the
      subjects (approximately 70%) were evaluated in the final two stages,
      the latter portion of the project's duration. This amount demonstrates
      a statistically significant correlation with search stage (&#967;2 =
      28.1214, df = 1, p-value &lt; .001) suggesting that subjects may be
      procrastinating or backfilling. 
    </p>
    <p>Over half the subjects reporting for the first deliverable reported
      being in a stage other than the initiation stage. This finding could be
      an indication that in this time frame, subjects found several documents
      and reported being in the initiation stage, and then after absorbing
      those initial set of documents, considered themselves out of the
      initiation stage and in some other stage. Subjects may have performed
      some significant portion of their research in this early stage, quickly
      moving beyond the initiation stage. 
    </p>
    <p>In reference to research question two, examination of the results
      concerning subjects' evaluation of the quality of Web resources
      provides some indication that subjects were not concerned with the
      quality, validity, or authority of the documents selected. Subjects
      selected the categories of source quality and authority (of sources) at
      a rate of between 55% or less than that of amount of information and
      depth (see Table 11) suggesting that these criteria were not as
      important to subjects as simply retrieving some quantity of information
      on their topic. Categories such as structure, amount of information,
      recency (currency) and depth were consistently selected more often by
      subjects, suggesting these criteria were more important to the subjects
      than source quality or the . 
    </p>
    <p>Subjects did not select verifying (presented as 'verifying
      information that has been gathered previously') for any particular
      deliverable at a rate higher than 16% (Table 7), suggesting that
      subjects generally found some other search stage category provided a
      better description of their behaviour. Based on these results, it
      appears subjects did not attempt to verify their sources, and it can be
      assumed they considered the information valid or were not concerned
      about the validity of the source. 
    </p>
    <p>In reference to research question three, subjects did appear to make
      use of general information sites such as Wikipedia, but they did not
      select these sites consistently throughout the search process. The
      instructions presented to subjects on the use of general information
      sites is obviously an intervening factor to be considered in the
      evaluation of this statistic. However, the timing of the selection and
      use of these sites by the subjects suggests that they were likely to
      select these sites in the extracting stage. Also, the selection of
      Wikipedia for approximately 15% of sites for the final deliverable
      suggests that for some subjects, these sites were useful in the later
      stages of the research project. The difference between the selection of
      these sites in early stages versus late stages, however, is not
      statistically significant. For this sample, subjects appeared just as
      likely to use these sites in early search stages (initiation,
      exploration) as in later search stages (differentiating, extracting,
      verifying).
    </p>
    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>The subjects in this study were from a US university. The articles
      referenced in the literature review also cited studies performed on
      subjects in US schools. It is not clear that search behaviour, or more
      broadly, the behaviour of Millennial generation subjects, will be the
      same in other cultures. Subjects were also undergraduate students with
      a mixed scholastic background (below average, average, above average).
      Graduate students or professionals may perform differently. 
    </p>
    <p>The task assigned students provided specific instructions to
      encourage students to perform research. Students were told that they
      were being graded partially on the quality of their research, and this
      meant that more quality sources cited would result in a higher grade.
      Specific instructions given to the subjects also addressed limiting the
      use of general information sites such as Wikipedia. These intervening
      factors may have encouraged students to evaluate more documents from
      quality sites and perform additional research during the later stages
      of the project. In the absence of these instructions, it is possible
      Wikipedia sites may have represented a larger portion of the sites
      selected and referenced. 
    </p>
    <p>This study was designed to allow the subjects to work in an
      environment outside of a lab at their own pace and at their own
      convenience. The intention was to create an environment where the
      subject would feel comfortable and behave in a typical manner and
      provide meaningful results on the common information behaviour of the
      Millennial generation. This meant that the subjects themselves reported
      their search stage and criteria and relevance as opposed to the method
      in many information behaviour studies where researchers provide that
      evaluation. Though subjects were tutored in the use of the system and
      provided with explanations for what was being reported, and though help
      prompts and help pages were available to subjects, there is the
      possibility that some subjects may have misinterpreted these
      instructions and that these prompts and requirements on reporting may
      have led to some non-typical behaviour on the part of subjects. 
    </p>
    <p>The task assigned to the students involved a subject area that was
      suitable for Web-based research. This assignment may have encouraged
      fragmented searches and retrieval since information for many of the
      assigned topics could be retrieved from multiple sources available on
      the Web. Other assignments, for example writing a paper on Western
      philosophy for a humanities course, might involve more focused searches
      with fewer sources. 
    </p>
    <p>The research methods employed allowed subjects to select topicality
      as a criterion, but did not specifically analyse topicality in relation
      to the selection of other criteria. This approach was based on the
      assumption that the document first needed to be on topic before other
      criteria would be considered (Wang and Sorgel 1998, Crystal and
      Greenberg 2006). This research focused on the use of more specific
      relevance criteria. 
    </p>
    <p>Additional influences on relevance decisions are known to be user's
      background or knowledge of the subject domain, and search task. The
      convenience sample for this research was drawn from a pool of
      undergraduate students who are business majors in a business school at
      an American university. All students were taking the same course and
      were given the same assignment, thus all had the same work task. These
      influences are mitigated in this study by drawing from a subject pool
      whose members have similar backgrounds, experiences, and domain
      knowledge. Though this aspect of the design of these studies attempted
      to control for variations in domain knowledge, variations in knowledge
      may exist within the subject pool. The choice of this convenience
      sample also limits the generalisability of the results.
    </p>
    <p>Though subjects could use any search engine to gather sources, the
      Yahoo! search engine was used by default since it was easier to
      integrate search results into the Web-based data collection instruments
      used in this study. Almost all subjects chose to use the default search
      engine. The search engine itself and the search results were not being
      examined in this study, but use of a different search engine as the
      default (for example, Google) may have produced different results.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span>
    </p>
    <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion </span></h2>
    <p>These findings provide some indication that the execution of
      searches by Millennial generation searchers may be problematic.
      Existing search models are appropriate; it is the execution of the
      model by the searcher within the context of the search environment that
      is at issue. Millennial generation searchers have come of age with
      different information gathering resources than their predecessors. The
      filter of the librarian-mediator relationship is gone and replaced by a
      profusion of fragmented and sometimes dubious information sources. It
      is within this environment that they search and gather the information
      they need. The results presented here provide some indication that
      members of the Millennial generation do not consider verification of
      Internet sources important, indicating a non-critical view of
      information found on the Internet. This is consistent with results by
      Gross and Latham (2011) who report that subjects in their study
      indicated that information quality was not a concern and express
      surprise and incredulity that there may be an objective measure of
      information evaluation. 
    </p>
    <p>These findings point towards an information literacy problem that
      may be based more on a perception rather than lack of information
      searching skills. The Millennial generation has come of age with
      technology that provides access to a vast variety of information
      sources. They constantly make choices concerning focus. They clearly
      know how to filter, the problem is what they choose to filter when
      evaluating information. 
    </p>
    <p>As Maybee (2006) indicated, learning involves a relationship between
      the learner and the subject matter. Changing the relationship involves
      changing the learner's perceptions. Subjects identified in Gross and
      Latham (2011) were not concerned with the quality of information
      gathered, consistent with the behaviour of the subjects in the study
      reported here who rarely reported validating information sources
      (identified as source quality). Gross and Latham (2011) further
      indicate that subjects did not perceive the existence of an objective
      standard for evaluating information (see Gross and Latham 2011: 173). Finding and
      evaluating information is subjective, reflecting a distinctly
      postmodernist view of information and knowledge. 
    </p>
    <p>It is this core perception of information quality as a subjective
      concept, and perhaps even a broader uncritical view of information in
      general, that must be addressed. Further research should explicate this
      view and perhaps the broader worldview of subjectivity versus
      objectivity amongst the Millennial generation. A better understanding
      of why members of this generation resist using objective information
      evaluation standards may provide strategies for addressing this
      perception and thus improving the search skills of the members of the
      Millennial generation.
