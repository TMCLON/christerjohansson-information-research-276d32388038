      <h3>What's a Web service?</h3>
	  <p><strong>The gist:</strong> Web services offer value-added information or
	  information processing on the Web.<br>
	  <strong>The implication:</strong> Share your expertise with the Web community.<br>
	  <strong>The opportunity: </strong> You can publish both your information and information 
	  processing procedures for others to leverage in their programs.<br>
	  <strong>An example: </strong> Agencies in your community might want to list your library 
	  hours on their Web sites. Their Web sites consume the Web service giving your library
	  hours.  If you change your hours, all the attendant Web sites automatically
	  reflect the changes.</p>
      <p>Suppose you're writing a computer program and you need a subroutine, a 
      method or a procedure. You could write your own, but suppose the very 
      procedure you need already exists on the Web compiled and ready to use. 
      Being economical, you write your program so that it utilizes the distant 
      procedure. You would be using a Web service.</p>
      <p>Note the similarity of this model to active Web content based on legacy 
      CGI (Common Gateway Interface) or ASP (Active Server Pages) technologies. 
      Typically they accepted user input and responded with HTML (Hypertext 
      Markup Language). Web services extend this model to the programming realm 
      of application-to-application sharing. My application can use a procedure 
      you wrote and make available on your server. Users of my program would be 
      oblivious to the provenance of the operations occurring before them.</p>
      <p>Historically, the desktop and the Web have been two different 
      environments. Web services blur that distinction as desktop applications 
      and Web applications can now share data and functionality. This is not an 
      absolutely original concept: many Windows desktop applications right now 
      will update themselves by automatically seeking new procedures and 
      contents from the Web. You are required to OK the download, thus it
	  doesn't occur invisibly in the background. Web 
      services extend this sharing model two ways: (1) All of us can create Web 
      services and bind them in our programs, and (2) The integration of program 
      and Web service occurs silently in the background.</p>
      <p><strong>Key idea:</strong> Web services let applications share data and 
      invoke capabilities of other applications. </p>
      <p><strong>Speculation:</strong> Is this the beginning of the <a href="http://informationr.net/ir/7-4/infres74.html">Semantic Web</a>? The vision of a
	  Semantic Web suggests a distributed network of meaning.  Web services would be
	  a fundamental building block of such a vision because they provide the 
	  distant semantic functionality.</p>
      <h3>What's the advantage of Web services?</h3>
      <p>The most compelling reason to use Web services is leveraging a distant 
      expertise in your own program. Why re-invent the wheel? </p>
      <p>Web services are shared using the ubiquitous HTTP (Hypertext Transfer 
      Protocol), thereby finessing the problem of heterogeneous operating 
      systems and technology suites. Updates can be made at the server, without 
      the need to distribute new DLLs (dynamic link libraries) to clients. Web 
      services promise enormous efficiencies in the sharing of data and 
      applications. Partisans of Web services, like Don Box of Microsoft, 
      envision rebuilding the Web by replacing HTTP with SOAP (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/">Simple Object Application Protocol</a>) 
      messages in place of the current packet-based system.</p>
      <blockquote>Ultimately, Web Services are just the next evolutionary step 
        in software integration. If we do our jobs well and make Web Services an 
        intrinsic part of the platform, then developers can go back to focusing 
        primarily on building applications. I do believe that those applications 
        will be considerably more interesting in a Web Service-based universe, 
        primarily due to the decentralized nature of integration and 
        development. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/02/12/default.aspx">

      <h3>Show me an example</h3>
      <p>UDDIs (Universal Description Discovery Integration) sites are the 
      yellow pages of Web services. At this time the <a href="http://uddi.microsoft.com/default.aspx">UDDI at Microsoft</a> has 
      about 850 listings. As of November 2002, my survey of Web 
      services at the Microsoft UDDI reveals that many of them return simply the 
      URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of a Web page, or address of a business. 
	  However, Web services directories are appearing such as 
	  <a href="http://www.remotemethods.com/">Remote Services</a> and
	  <a href="http://www.webservicesmall.com/">Web Services Mall</a></p>
      
	  
	  
      <p><strong>Ironic comment:</strong> UDDI classifies Web services using 
      classification schemes such as the North American Industry Classification 
      System (NAICS - 1997), Universal Standard Products and Services Codes 
      (UNSPSC-7.03) and the Standard Industry Classification (SIC-1987) and so 
      on. Where is the evidence of the librarians, taxonomy experts, and 
      indexers? Have they been ignored again by on-rushing technology?</p>
      <h3>Inhibitors of Web services</h3>
      <p>Can I really trust your Web service? Will your Web service persist in 
      time? In the future will you begin to charge for your Web 
      service? </p>
      <p><strong>Key idea:</strong> Social aspects may inhibit the use of Web 
      services. Examples of crucial limiting social aspects: Security threats 
      and fear of too much centralization in the hands of one company.</p>
      <p>Expect to see the efficiencies of Web services applied in communities 
      of trust. An example would be a highly constrained corporate environment where 
      work groups need to leverage the expertise within a large, distributed 
      enterprise. For example, 
	  <a href="http://www.knowledgetechnologies.net/proceedings/presentations/tsao/ScottTsao-BldgXMLCoP_files/frame.htm">Scott Tsao</a> 
	  of the Boeing corporation speaks of building a "community of practice."  This is a company-wide community of 
      practice for XML in The Boeing Company that has a common culture, concept framework and trust based on
	  knowing who designed and maintains distributed computer resources.</p>
      <p><strong>The bottom line: </strong>Watch Web services will flourish and manifest an aspect of the Semantic Web, 
      but only in constrained communities of trust.</p>
