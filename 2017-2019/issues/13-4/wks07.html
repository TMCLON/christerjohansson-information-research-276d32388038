<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Evidence based practice has emerged as an influential paradigm
for health care practitioners, beginning with physicians before
proceeding to nurses and allied health professionals. In the 21st
century, health information is abundant, and the challenge is no longer
to find or access information, but to locate and make use of good
quality information, or evidence, in order to deliver the best possible
health care. In information studies, the information behaviour of
health professionals (physicians and nurses) and allied health
professionals can be studied to better understand what information
these clinicians need, how they seek and how they use information to
inform practice.</p>

<p>Rehabilitation therapists, including occupational therapists,
physiotherapists, and speech-language pathologists, play an essential
role in health care. Even so, their information behaviour is overlooked
in the literature in information studies. The information behaviour of
health professionals such as physicians and nurses is better understood
as a result of studies on their information needs, information seeking
behaviour and information use. </p>

<p>In order to improve the training and informational services to
rehabilitation therapists for supporting evidence based practice, their information
behaviour, particularly their information needs, require identification
and explanation. This study explores the information needs of
rehabilitation therapists that arise during the patient encounter, that
is, their clinical questions, as a preliminary step in understanding
rehabilitation therapists' information behaviour and how it compares to
that of health professionals.
</p>

<p>Clinical questions are the formalized information needs arising from patient care. Taylor's (<a href="#tay68">1968</a>) typology of information needs, which is the most often cited in the literature (<a href="#cas07">Case 2007</a>), includes four types of information needs, or questions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Q1. Visceral need (unexpressed)</li>
<li>Q2. Conscious need (acknowledge, in the brain)</li>
<li>Q3. Formalized need (expressed, formal statement)</li>
<li>Q4. Compromised need (input into the system)</li>
</ul>

<p>The formalized need (Q3) is the type of information need that this
research study is concerned with. According to Taylor, &quot;at this level
an inquirer can form a qualified and rational statement of his
question. Here he is describing his area of doubt in concrete terms and
he may or may not be thinking within the contexts or constraints of the
system from which he wants information&quot; (<a href="#tay98">Taylor 1968</a>:
182). In the context of patient care, this formalized information need
is called a clinical question. Note that a clinical question need not
be in the form of an interrogative statement (i.e., ending with a question
mark), but may take the form of a declarative statement. It must,
however, indicate a gap in information related to patient care. </p>


<h2>Research problem</h2>

<p>Rehabilitation therapists form a significant proportion of allied
health professionals, and are central to health care delivery. As
practitioners, rehabilitation therapists engage in information
behaviour: they identify information needs, decide whether or not to
seek answers to these needs, engage in seeking behaviour, and then
decide on how to use the information to improve patient care. Even so,
rehabilitation therapists are neglected in the literature on
information behaviour. Little is known about the information needs that
arise in rehabilitation therapists' day-to-day practice and how they
cope with these needs through information seeking and use. </p>

<p>In her review of information seeking behaviour, Marshall (<a href="#mar93">1993</a>)
remarked that there was very little research on professionals others
than physicians, and this proportion remains relatively constant to the
present day. While several studies purport to describe the information
behaviour of rehabilitation therapists, none of these were conducted by
information studies researchers in the context of information behaviour
theory. Information seeking is but one aspect of information behaviour
research, along with needs and use. Few studies report on the actual
information needs of rehabilitation therapists in any depth. </p>

<p>At the same time, the evidence based practice framework is being encouraged in the field of rehabilitation (<a href="#bur98">Bury and Mead 1998</a>; <a href="#pla06">Plastow 2006</a>; <a href="#rei04">Reilly <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>; <a href="#tay00">Taylor 2000</a>), and rehabilitation therapists are expected to be skilled at asking
clinical questions, retrieving relevant evidence, and appraising and
applying the evidence to their practice (<a href="#apt05">American Physical Therapy Association 2005</a>; <a href="#cao08">Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists 2008</a> and <a href="#rob04">Robey <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>). 
</p>

<p>There is much evidence to inform rehabilitation therapists' clinical practice, but research suggests that is often not used (<a href="#dys02">Dysart and Tomlin 2002</a>; <a href="#jet03">Jette <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>; <a href="#swe01">Sweetland and Craik 2001</a>; <a href="#tur97">Turner and Whitfield 1997</a>).
That is, despite efforts to teach and promote evidence based practice, it is not being
implemented by rehabilitation therapists. Various obstacles have been
identified that inhibit the implementation of evidence based practice in rehabilitation (<a href="#hum00">Humphris <em>et al.</em> 2000</a>; <a href="#pol00">Pollock <em>et al.</em> 2000</a>), including rehabilitation therapists' difficulty in formulating clinical questions (<a href="#ben03">Bennett <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>). In the past few years, new databases have emerged to support evidence based practice for rehabilitation, including PEDro (<a href="#ser00">Sherrington <em>et al.</em> 2000</a>), OTseeker (<a href="#mck04">McKenna <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>), and Hooked on Evidence (<a href="#sca03">Scalzitti 2003</a>).
These databases assume that users have specific clinical questions, and
that they possess the required search skills to locate the evidence.
User studies on these databases demonstrate that this is not the case,
as search terms entered are often vague (<a href="#ben06">Bennett <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>). Research is needed to identify what clinical questions rehabilitation
therapists ask, and if these are in fact conducive to evidence based practice.
</p>

<h2>Purpose and objectives</h2>

<p>This study links the information needs of rehabilitation therapists
to the activity of patient care, and is therefore a study of the
person-in-context, or of rehabilitation therapists as providers of
patient care. Patient care is one of several roles undertaken by
rehabilitation therapists in which individualized attention and
decision making takes place to inform and improve the patient's
condition. </p>

<p>The purpose of this research is to explore rehabilitation
therapists' clinical questions for evidence based patient care. The
research can be broken down into several narrower objectives:</p>

<ul>
<li>To identify clinical questions which arise during and after the patient encounter;</li>
<li>To examine clinical questions for common elements or patterns, such as those suggested by the evidence based practice framework;</li>
<li>To categorize clinical questions;</li>
<li>To discover why some clinical questions are pursued while others are not.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Methodology and method</h2>

<p>The objectives of this research are best understood within the
philosophical tradition of interpretive or qualitative research. Using
purposive sampling, clinical questions will be sought from between 10
to 15 informants working in a rehabilitation centre serving patients
with stroke. For this research, it is expected that approximately 100
clinical questions will be collected in total. These clinical questions
arising from patient encounters will be recorded by informants using a
structured journal over the course of one or two weeks. The clinical
questions from each informant will be analyzed before being
supplemented a semi-structured interview to clarify the clinical
questions and explore other aspects of the research objectives. </p>


<h2>Progress to date</h2>

<p>The doctoral research project is currently at the proposal writing
stage, with the methods of data collection and analysis being refined.
Once the proposal is successfully defended, in early 2009, data
collection will begin.
