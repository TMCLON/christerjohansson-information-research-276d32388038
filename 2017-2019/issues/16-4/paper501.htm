  <p><strong>Introduction.</strong> We report a study that probed the  information media consumption trends of the New York City subway. A large  number of Americans living in urban environments spend a significant part of  their daily lives on public transport, yet there are relatively few studies of  the commuters' information behaviour.<br />
    <strong>Method.</strong> The study collected data through observation, interview and  survey. Observations were conducted on 15 New York City subway lines by seven  Information and Library Science students. Observers recorded the number of  riders, types and number of information devices the riders used and how these  devices were used. A few riders were interviewed about their use of information  technology during their commutes; notes from the interviews were recorded  immediately after the interviews. A survey about commuters&rsquo; information activities  and preferences was distributed primarily to the Information and Library  Science students at Pratt Institute.<br />
    <strong>Analysis.</strong> Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were carried out on  the data, which included 154 observations, thirteen interviews and 460 survey  responses. Quantitative analysis employed the statistical package SPSS and  Microsoft Excel. Analysis of the interview data was performed by two  independent coders. <br />
    <strong>Results.</strong> We found that roughly one-half of the commuters relied on  various information devices for reading, typing, listening to music and other  activities. The most popular activities on the trains included reading books,  using a smartphone, and listening to music. The other half of the commuters was  not actively engaged in the use of information devices. Among the factors that  were found to be correlated with the commuters&rsquo; information activities were  information device ownership, time of the day, commute length, commuters&rsquo;  demographic characteristics, environmental conditions and other variables.<br />
    <strong>Conclusions.</strong> Comparison of the study findings with previous research  suggests that while information technology and services will continue to  evolve, their use by commuters will very likely fit into several categories  (e.g. productive use, use for entertainment, and non-use). Implications of the  study findings and directions for the future research are discussed.<strong></strong></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>According to the 2000 US Census, of  the 128,279,228 Americans age 16 and older who commute to work, 6,067,703 use  the subways (U.S. Census Bureau 2004). In New York City alone, the number of subway  journeys made in 2009 was 1,604,198,017 (Metropolitan Transportation Authority  2011). Yet, there is very little publicly available research on the information  behaviour of subway commuters, and particularly New York City subway commuters.  To fill in this information gap, we have engaged in a study probing media  consumption trends of New York City subway riders. We felt that the study would  be particularly timely considering the plans to introduce wireless service on the  Metropolitan Transportation Authority&rsquo;s underground sections (Transit Wireless 2010),  since it could quantify the social value of extending cellular service into the  majority of the areas serviced by the New York City subway lines.<br />
</p>
<p>We applied a number of methods,  including observation, interview, and survey to examine the types and purposes  of information devices used on New York City subways.<br />
  </p>
<p>The article reviews relevant studies  of travellers' behaviour, describes methods used in our research, reports and  discusses results, and outlines directions for future investigations of  commuters' information behaviour.</p>
<h2>Relevant literature</h2>
<p>Reviewed literature can be divided  into three broad categories: 1) articles that discuss classifications of  commuters' behaviour; 2) articles that suggest technical solutions to address  certain commuters' information needs; and 3) scientific and non-scientific  publications about commuters' preferences for information media and activities.<br />
  </p>
<p>One of the few classifications of  commuters' information activities can be found in Flamm (2005). The author  argues that travel time should not be considered &lsquo;dead time&rsquo;, but rather a  transitional space in which travellers participate in a multitude of  activities. Flamm interviewed twenty subjects from major metropolitan areas in  Switzerland (Geneva, Lausanne, Bern and Basel) and based on their responses  derived three main categories of travellers&rsquo; activities: 1) productive  activities, 2) relaxation and transition related activities, and 3) social  activities. In Flamm's classification, productive activities relate both to  work and leisure: work-related activities include planning tasks, writing or  reviewing documents, and talking to colleagues, while leisure-related  activities include reading newspapers or books. Relaxation activities include  listening to music, daydreaming, dozing and playing games. Social activities  are related to maintaining social relationships with family or friends, and  include observing surroundings.<br />
  </p>
<p>Several classifications of  commuters' activities are reviewed in Brossard <em>et al</em>. (2009). The authors describe an information portal that was  designed considering travellers' attitudes and emotions. The portal organized  information into the following rubrics based on commuters' interests:  communication, transport, general, leisure, and work-related information. One  of the studies referenced in Brossard <em>et  al.</em> (2009) was conducted by Viatic Mobilite team&nbsp; that classified commuters based on levels of  concentration and openness to others (Figure 1). Viatic researchers (as cited  in Brossard&nbsp; <em>et al. </em>2009) used zoomorphic labels to define the categories, which  include (1) beavers that engage in productive activities, (2) owls that feel  lost and look for information, (3) peacocks that are showing off, and (4)  marmots that rest (clockwise from top left in Figure 1).<br />

<p>Similar classification is mentioned  in the Akesson and Nilsson (2002) study. Even though researchers focused on the  activities of car commuters, the categories of the identified activities are  similar to the previous classification, and include vocational, mundane and  traffic-related activities (see Table 1)</p>

<p>Akesson and Nilsson found a  variation in the activities commuters were engagingin on the way to work,  versus those they pursued returning from work. For example, on the way <em>to </em>work most of the activities were  work-related, such as plan a day or sync a calendar; while on the way <em>from</em> work most of the activities were  leisure-related, such as calling a friend. The interviews revealed that  possible desired activities that commuters would have preferred to engage in  had they had the right technology and/or application evolved around the three  categories: vocational, mundane and traffic related.<br />
</p>
<p>While the reviewed classifications  differ in the number of categories and methods used to develop them, they all  include some forms of productive and leisurely activities.<br />
</p>
<p>An example of a study that developed  and tested a software application for commuters' use can be found in Belloni <em>et al.</em> (2009). The authors developed and  tested the use of a mobile friend-finding application on the subway system in  Stockholm. As part of the study, the authors asked eight subway users to  document their journey experience by taking photographs from their mobile  phones. The authors provided emotional criteria for taking pictures, and asked  participants to imagine &lsquo;something good during their journey, something  unexpected, something that makes the journey shorter, unique, annoying,  something to be changed, something of their choice&rsquo; (Bellonie <em>et  al.</em> 2009: &nbsp;4545). Analysis of the  participants' photographs, which the authors refer to as &lsquo;cultural probes&rsquo;,  suggested the presence of isolated and lonely experiences during subway  commuting. To mitigate the negative effects of commute, the authors developed a  mobile phone application that notified commuters when their friends were on the  same train. The authors argue that the application shows the possibilities of  changing commuting from an isolated experience into a social one. <br />
</p>
<p>A number of the examined  publications focused on the use of specific information devices or applications  for these devices by commuters. Grasi <em>et  al.</em> (2010) examined the use of mobile phones to relieve stress and anxiety.  The authors found that students who used mobile devices during their commute to  listen to music and watch videos were less stressed. The students also felt  better, because they had the sense of accomplishment during their commute.  Similar finding can be found in the sociological research of commuting patterns  by Lyons and Urry (2004), who note that technology has helped to make travel  more productive, and many commuters prefer to use public transportation, rather  than car, because they can use the time productively.<br />
</p>
<p>Paez and Whalen (2010) examined  university students' attitudes toward their commutes and derived results  similar to the Grasi <em>et al.</em> (2010)  study. In particular, authors found that students seemed to enjoy their commute  much more if they were able to engage in a productive activity (e.g. doing work  while sitting on a bus versus doing nothing while driving a car). Colbert and  Livingstone (2006) examined ways to increase mobile technologies&rsquo; usefulness  during a commute. The authors asked twenty students to keep diaries and  describe their commuting experiences in order to understand desirable  conditions for use of cell phones for calls or texting. The study did not find  any clear patterns regarding preferable public transportation conditions, since  individual preferences or annoyances varied widely. However, the study findings  suggested that participants preferred taking a bus or a train to driving. Some  participants reported feeling comfortable making calls on a bus or train  because it could provide a quiet and comfortable environment for the  conversation. Others felt uncomfortable making calls with bystanders  overhearing.<br />
</p>
<p>A number of more informal publications  on the open Web and in the newspapers report the results of casual observations  of travellers' behaviour. We chose to review some of these publications because  they attest to the emerging public interest in the topic of information use on  subway commutes.<br />
</p>
<p>Functionality of an Apple iPad is  discussed in a blog entry from the UK (Baxevanis, 2010); the author argues that  all information activities commuters engage in can be performed on the Apple'  iPad. Totilo (2010) discusses iPad capability as a gaming device for New York  City subway commuters. Through interactions with other commuters and personal  experiences in using the iPad, Totilo critiques some of the device's  functionality (e.g. difficulties of using it on a crowded train.) Another  blogger (Comeau, 2010) reports his observations of the gaming device uses on the  subway. He conducted informal observations and found that for every person  using a portable gaming device, there were at least twenty people playing games  on their smartphones (Comeau, 2010). Comeau also points out that smartphone apps  and games are a booming market while Nintendo and other gaming companies'  profits are not as strong as they used to be. Furthermore, most people who  already have a smartphone would prefer to only carry and use one device. He  argues that with the introduction of iPad and iPhone, there is no longer a need  to carry multiple devices (Comeau, 2010).<br />
</p>
<p>Several articles in the New York  Times looked at how New Yorkers are spending their time on the train. Mainland  (2009) tried to understand the reading habits of commuters by observing and  interviewing New York City subway riders. The article focused primarily on  books and described how people relate to their surroundings while reading. The  author argues that it is the lack of Internet and mobile service access on the  subway that keeps New Yorkers reading books on the subway rather than using  electronic devices.<br />
  </p>
<p>In summary, prior studies of travellers'  behaviour reflect diversity of commuting experiences, and preferences for  various types of activities and information devices. Our study extended prior  work by broadening the focus and examining the use of a wide variety of  information devices on the New York City subway. Unlike most of the prior  studies, we applied a number of methods and relied on larger samples to outline  the landscape of information technology use by underground travellers.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Due to a lack of  understanding of subway commuters&rsquo; information behaviour and the absence of pre-existing  models of this behaviour, the study was to a large extent exploratory in  nature. We used observation, survey and interview to investigate the  information behaviour of New York City commuters. We defined commuters' information  behaviour as observable or self-reported interactions (or lack of interaction)  with information media. These observable interactions or activities became a  focus of our study. <br />
  </p>
<p>Use of multiple methods allowed us  to investigate the following research questions:<br />
  </p>
<p>1. What  information activities do commuters engage in?<br />
  2. What information devices do they use?<br />
  </p>
<p>In order to examine the distribution  and uses of information devices on the New York City subway, a series of  observations were made between 24 September and 9 October 2010. Eight  researchers made 154 observations of fifteen subway lines (see Figure 2 for the  subway lines that were observed for the study). A total of 4,461 passengers was  observed during different times of day and on various lengths of commute. <br />
  </p>
<p>Upon entering a subway car, each researcher first  counted the number of persons in the car, then noted down what media device  each person was utilizing, and observed what they were doing on the device. After  each stop, the passengers were re-counted and changes in the device presence  and use were noted. Each subway car was observed by one researcher at a time. In cases where a subway car was  extremely crowded, the observers estimated the total number of passengers  visually but counted device usage in a specific portion of the car. We had  hypothesized that subjects in more crowded cars would be less likely to use  devices or media that required two hands to use, so observers made notes if the  car was extremely crowded.<br />
  </p>
<p>The observers performed unconcealed  participant observations, but tried to remain discreet while making the  observations. During each observation, field notes were taken in small  notebooks or mobile devices. Observations were made between consecutive subway  stations including end of the line stations where subjects were either only  boarding or only leaving. Each observation consisted of a count of passengers  (either exact or, in cases of extreme crowding, estimated) and a breakdown of  print format and electronic devices being used by those passengers. Only  observations with exact passenger counts were included in the analysis (N=122).<br />
  </p>
<p>A pilot study  was carried out before the main study to determine the range of information devices  utilized on the New York City subway system. Based on the results of the pilot  observations, we counted interactions with five traditional print media (books,  magazines, printouts (including photocopies), notebooks, and newspapers) and  five electronic device types (e-readers, laptop computers, music players,  gaming devices and smartphones). <br />
  </p>
<p>Multi-function devices such as  iPods, smartphones and so forth can display text, play games, show video, and  play music. They are also capable of two-way asynchronous communication through  SMS texting and synchronous voice communication through the cellular network  system or via VoIP networks. Since we were more interested in commuter activities  (how the device is used) than device choice, we decided to count each of these  uses separately. Smartphones and similar multi-use devices were grouped with  single-purpose devices based on their observed use.<br />
  </p>
<p>It was not  possible to individually observe the screen of each handheld device, given the  privacy considerations. Instead, several body-language clues were used to  determine how a handheld device is being used (see Appendix A for the list of  observed devices and information activities). </p>
<p>In addition  to counting devices and their uses, we also counted two types of commuters&rsquo;  interactions with their surroundings. The first type was classified as &lsquo;staring  at the walls of the cars/reading the car ads&rsquo; and included instances whentraveler&rsquo;s gaze  was obviously directed at the advertisement and/or poster on a wall. We assumed  that staring is an active effort to obtaining textual or visual information  from the sources designed to deliver a message. The second type of interaction  with an environment was classified as &lsquo;doing nothing&rsquo;, a passive activity of commuters  who did not interact with any information devices, only occasionally glanced at  the walls of the subway cars, observed  the environment without interacting with it, or appeared to be resting. </p>
<p>In addition  to the passenger and media count, we recorded the date and time of the  observation, the subway stations defining the start and end of the observation,  whether the train was underground or above ground, an estimated crowding level,  and any additional notes the observer thought might be relevant. Recording  subway station and line enabled us to determine whether the observation was  taken above ground, and consequently if wireless access was available for an  augmented use of certain devices. It also helped us to ensure that our  observations are covering wide area of the city and its diverse population. </p>
<p>In selecting the subway lines for the observations, we were  primarily interestedin obtaining a  representative sample of New York City population; therefore we selected the  lines that connect various parts of town and various neighborhoods. While our observations did not cover  every&nbsp; subway line, we feel that our  sample is representative of the New York City subway system (Appendix E and  Figure 2).&nbsp; In an attempt to obtain a  representative sample of the commuters, our observations were also conducted at  various times of the day, and on various days of the week (see Table 4 in  Appendix A for the distribution of observations across various times of the day/week). </p>

  <strong>Figure 2. New York City MTA map (observed lines  appear in bold) </strong></p>
<p>During our observations, we  conducted thirteen short semi-structured informal interviews in an effort to  determine how the passengers use their information devices and why. Nine males  and four females were interviewed across eight different subway lines either in  a subway car or on a platform. Each participant was chosen based on their  willingness to discuss their devices on the condition of anonymity. Researchers  approached subjects and secured permission to ask questions and use results in  a paper. Most of the questions researchers asked were about the devices  commuters carried and/or used, the nature of information tasks performed on the  devices, and reasons for commuters&rsquo; preference for specific devices. General  demographic information with no identifying details was recorded (e.g. gender,  approximate age). Interview notes were taken immediately after conversations.  The text of the interview notes was coded to identify the themes related to  commuters' use of information devices on the subway and is discussed in the  Results section.<br />
</p>
<p>Analysis of the observation and  interview data informed the design of a short survey that was created to better  understand variables that might affect commuters' activities and preferences  (Appendix B). The survey contained ten questions, four of which collected  demographic data. The survey was created using the online <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com">SurveyMonkey</a> application and took about five minutes to complete. The survey was distributed  through the Pratt Institute LIS school electronic mailing list, which has  approximately 300 subscribers, who were asked to further distribute the survey,  resulting in 460 responses. While the survey is based on convenience sample, it  is an accepted method used in exploratory research (Grasi <em>et al.</em> 2010, Paez and Whalen 201, Teevan <em>et al.</em> 2010), and represented demographically diverse group of New  York City commuters (see Appendix C for the demographic information of the  subway respondents).<br />
  </p>
<p>Our exploratory study had a  number of limitations. We used a convenience sample, which limits  generalizability of our findings. We only observed subway lines, excluding  other forms of public transportation (e.g. buses, ferries, taxi cabs). We did  not observe all subway lines at all times of the day, and only glimpsed at a  long list of all possible activities that were engaged in by commuters. When  planning a study, we focused primarily on the travellers&rsquo; interactions with  information devices, and designed our survey and interviews accordingly.  However, during the course of our observations we learned that a large number  of commuters do not actively engage with any devices. Investigation of the commuters  who do not interact with any devices would be an interesting focus for the  future studies. Another limitation includes lack of a formal measure of inter-observer  reliability which was monitored throughout study through observers&rsquo; training  and regular communication amongst research team members during the data collection  phase of the project. </p>
<p>Most of the study&rsquo;s  limitations were due to the novelty of our research on commuters&rsquo; behaviour: we  had to learn from our mistakes as we proceeded with the study. However, we  think that our findings offer a good probe of the information universe of the New  York City subway riders. We also think that due to the demographic diversity of  New York City subway commuters, the information behaviour trends of commuters  might represent trends in a broader population.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>Observation</h3>
<p>We spent 23.45 hours observing 4,461  people on fifteen lines (1, 2, 6, 7, A, C, E, F, G, J, L, M, N, Q, R) of the  New York City subway system. We recorded observations for the following  activities that we saw people engaging in: reading a book, reading an e-reader,  typing or reading on a mobile phone, listening to music on a mobile device,  making a call on a mobile phone, playing a game on a mobile gaming device,  reading a newspaper, reading a magazine, reading printouts or photocopies,  using a laptop computer, staring at advertising on the walls of the train,  reading or writing in a notebook.<br />
  </p>
<p>Most of the observed commuters did  not engage with any type of information media (52.6%, see Figure 3). The most  common activity among commuters who used information devices was listening to  music on a mobile device, which was observed 756 times (16.9%). The second-most  popular activity observed was reading or typing on a mobile phone (n=353,  7.9%), followed by reading books (n=336, 7.5%), newspapers (n= 227, 5.1%), and  magazines (n=98, 2.2%). Mobile phone calls were observed 85 times (1.9%). Staring  at advertising on the walls of the train was observed 71 times (1.6%), followed  closely by playing a game on a mobile gaming device (n=68, 1.5%). Reading on an  e-reader was observed 36 times (0.8%) and reading or writing in a notebook was  observed 17 times (0.4%). Use of a laptop was the least frequently observed  activity, accounting for 7 observations (0.2%).<br />

  <strong>Figure  3: Information devices observed on subway trains</strong></p>
<p><br />
  In addition to analyzing  the frequency of observed devices and their uses, we examined whether  frequencies of observed devices and activities were related to the subway line  and the time of the day when the observation occurred. We hypothesized the  existence of relationships between the type of devices commuters used and the  subway line where the observation occurred. For example, commuters who take  subway lines that go above ground will have cell phone reception that might  lead to more frequent uses of their mobile devices, or certain subway lines  might be taken by commuters coming from various socio-economic backgrounds that  determine their ownership of certain devices. Similarly, we assumed that  certain times of the day, such as during the morning rush hour, would be  associated with certain commuting conditions (e.g. crowding) that would affect  information device uses.<br />
  </p>
<p>To examine the distribution  of information devices and activities per subway line we conducted a frequency  count, which indicated that listening to a music device with headphones was the  most frequently observed activity on most of the observed lines (F, M, N, C, L,  E, 7, A, J, and 6 lines.) Reading a book was the most frequently observed  activity on the G and Q lines. Listening to music and mobile texting/typing were  tied for the most frequently observed activity on the R line, while reading a  book, listening to music and reading printouts were tied for the most  frequently observed activity on the 2 line. We did not conduct a detailed  analysis of the subway lines to identify the differences between their characteristics  (e.g. passenger demographics), so results are linked to different subway lines to  bring attention to the fact that the distribution of various devices is not  homogeneous across lines.<br />
  </p>
<p>We also used Lambda test of  association (used on nominal data) to explore the relationships between subway  line observed and type of devices used during the observations. Table 2 below  shows Lambda values that represent relationships between dependent and  independent variables. While the relationships between various types of  information devices and subway lines where observations occurred were mostly  weak, some relationships were stronger (and statistically significant) than  others. Specifically, knowing a subway line can improve the prediction of  whether commuters' are listening to the music (<em>l </em>= .194, <em>p</em> &nbsp;= .002), &nbsp;reading/typing on a mobile device (<em>l </em>= .184 , <em>p</em> &nbsp;= .000), calling (<em>l </em>= .163 , <em>p</em> &nbsp;= .000) or reading a book (<em>l </em>= .153, <em>p</em> &nbsp;= .014) anywhere from 19.4% to 15.3%. Low  Lambda values for other variables correlations suggest that staring at walls,  reading printout, newspapers, and magazines, interacting with notebooks, e-readers,  gaming devices and laptops do not significantly vary across different subway  lines.</p>

<p>Analysis of  the distribution of information activities and devices across various times of  the day indicated that throughout the day, the most frequently observed  activity was not actively using any information devices, or, in other words,  doing nothing (see Figure 4). Listening to music was the most popular activity  (N=756); it peaked in the morning (21.2%) and decreased during later hours  (17%, 15.7%, 15.1%, respectively). Newspaper reading also peaked in the morning  (14%) and dramatically decreased during mid-day, afternoon rush, and  post-afternoon rush hours (4%, 3.4%, 3%, respectively). The distribution of the  mobile device uses for reading and typing did not vary significantly throughout  the day (7.7% for the morning rush hour, 6.8% mid-day, 9.1% afternoon rush  hour, and 10.2% evening).<br />

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Figure  4: Observations by time of day (&gt;5% observed in detail)</strong></p>
<p>Several  information activities were observed infrequently and comprised less than 5% of  all commuters' activities (including passive engagements with the surroundings,  see Figure 5). Among the relatively infrequent activities, staring at the car  walls increased by 2.5% between morning and evening hours; calling from mobile  phones was observed only 0.7% of times during the morning peak hours, but  increased to 2.6% in the later times of the day; use of gaming devices  increased during later hours (2.1%), while the magazine readership was steady  throughout the day but went down in the evening hours (from 2.1% during morning  rush hours to 1.9% in the evening). Distributions of certain activities peaked  in various types of day (e.g. usage of e-readers peaked during the morning  rush-hours at 1.4% compared to 0.6%, 0.7% and 0.8% during other time  intervals), while readers of printouts increased during the mid-day commutes.<br />
  <img src="Information Behaviors of NYC Subway Commuters_files/IRtemplate_clip_image010.jpg" alt="figure5" width="571" height="341" border="0" /></p>
<p><br />
  <strong>Figure 5: Observations by time of day (&lt;5% observed in detail)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We compared  the distribution of information activities on above ground trains (with  wireless access) and underground trains (without wireless access). On the above  ground trains we observed a higher number of mobile devices used for making  calls, reading and typing, as well as more frequent reading of traditional  books and passive observations of surroundings (combined in the Nothing category,  see Figure 6).<br />
  <img src="Information Behaviors of NYC Subway Commuters_files/IRtemplate_clip_image012.gif" alt="figure6" width="474" height="403" border="0" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure  6: Distribution of devices/activities in above ground and underground trains</strong></p>
<p>During our observations, we have  noted many activities that would be interesting to investigate in the future  studies. For example, we observed New York City police officers using  smartphones underground: it would be interesting to know how public servants  use them and why. We have noted that certain train lines and commute times are  associated with specific demographics (e.g. during rush hours, most of the  riders of an observed New Jersey railway line were middle-aged males); such  findings might inform future studies of the information behaviour of specific  commuters' populations.</p>
<h3>Interviews</h3>
<p>Thirteen unstructured interviews  were conducted by six researchers. Detailed notes were taken immediately after  interviewing subway travellers. The text of the notes was analysed by two  independent coders who identified the following themes: device type, purpose of  device, preference for the device, and frequency of usage. The level of  inter-coder agreement on identified themes was high (Cronbach's Alpha was  calculated at .91, see Nunnaly 1978).<br />
  </p>
<p>The devices most frequently  mentioned were Apple's iPhone (n=4) and iPod (n=4). Participants reported using  the iPhone for work-related tasks, such as reading PDFs (one participant noted:  &lsquo;I usually get pretty into what I am reading and barely notice that I am using  it [iPhone]&rsquo;), gaming, and news applications.<br />
  </p>
<p>iPod users reported using the device  not solely for music, but also for podcasts. One particular interviewee noted  the preference for the iPod on shorter commutes: &lsquo;I guess this trip is a short  one, so the podcast is kind of nice. With really short trips I wouldn't bother  with a book, I like to get into what I am reading.&rsquo;<br />
  </p>
<p>The most frequently mentioned  activities were grouped into larger families based on the purpose commuters  ascribed to activity: entertainment, textual or text-based, mobile device specific  and work-related tasks (see Appendix B).<br />
  The most frequent activity mentioned  by interviewed commuters was listening to music, followed by reading books.  Texting and emailing followed. Listening to music was often accompanied by  another activity. For example, one participant remarked: &lsquo;I sometimes listen to  music on it while I read the paper.&rsquo; Both iPods and iPhones were mentioned as  devices used for listening to music.<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Survey</strong><br />
  </p>
<p>Four hundred and sixty (N=460)  people filled out the commuter survey between 8 and 29&nbsp; October 2010. A copy of the survey can be  found in Appendix C. A large percentage of the respondents (60%) reported using  public transportation eleven or more times a week; the rest of the respondents  used it less often. Three quarters of the respondents (75.7%) spend between 30 and  120 minutes daily commuting on public transportation. Fewer respondents (15.3%)  spend less than 30 minutes on public transportation, and even fewer (9%) spend more  than 120 minutes or more a day. <br />
  </p>
<p>Participants were asked to identify  activities they engaged in during commuting (more than one activity could be  selected, see Figure 7). The most frequently identified activity on a train was  reading printed material (18%) followed by observing people (17%) and &nbsp;listening to music (16%). Among the least  frequently reported activities weremaking phone calls (2%), and watching videos  (2%).<br />

  <strong>Figure  7: Activities of subway riders</strong><br />
  (Note: survey respondents were asked to check all applicable options.)<br />
  </p>
<p>Participants were also  asked to identify information devices that they use during the commute (see  Figure 8). The most frequently reported activity was reading a book (22%),  followed by the use of a smartphone (18%), music device (17%), reading a  journal or magazine (14%), printouts or photocopies for school or work (14 %),  newspaper (8%), reading from e-reader (3%), use of a laptop (2%), gaming device  (1%), iPad or other tablet (1%).<br />

  <strong>Figure 8:  Information devices used on subway trains</strong><br />
  (Note: survey respondents were asked to check all applicable options.)<br />
  </p>
<p>When asked  to identify factors that influence what they do on a train, the majority of the  respondents choose crowding, followed by the length of commute (Figure 9).  Ambient lighting and time of day were primarily identified as factors that  somewhat influencewhat they do. Respondents were split in their estimation of  importance of a subway line (underground or above ground) in choosing their  activities during the commute. Forty-eight respondents said other factors influence  what they do on a train, including seating availability (n=22), availability of  company or friends (n=8), mood (n=6), destination (n=5), availability of an  information media (n=5) and noise levels (n=4).</p>

<p><strong>Figure 9: Factors that influence activities on  a train</strong><br />
  (Note: survey respondents were asked to check all applicable options)</p>
<p>The majority of respondents  (65.6%) indicated that the addition of wireless or cell phone service in  underground subway trains and stations would change their preferences for  information devices.<br />
  </p>
<p>Respondents' demographic  characteristics are summarized in Appendix D. The majority of the respondents  (60.1%) were between ages 25 and 34. Responses about the household income  clustered around the opposite ends of the lowest and highest possible values.  About a quarter of respondents reported a total household income of $100,000  per year or higher, 19.4% reported earning $20,000 to $29,999. Most of the  respondents reported living in New York City's five boroughs, 41.7% reported  Brooklyn as their place of residence, followed by 25.7% in Manhattan, 10.1% in  Queens, 2.0% in Bronx, and 0.7% in Staten Island. The rest of the respondents  reported living outside the New York. More than half of the respondents had  been to college; the rest reported having a professional degree (2.6%) or a  high school diploma (0.7%).<br />
  </p>
<p>In addition to examining  frequencies of survey responses, we ran a few correlations to explore the  relationships between the types of devices respondents reported carrying and  the types of activities they engaged in. We were interested to see whether  preferences for certain devices correlated with preferences for certain types  of activities. For example, if a person reported listening to the music or  playing games, what was the most likely information device s/he would carry; or  what are the most likely activities of the travellers who carry smartphones.<br />
  </p>
<p>The survey responses to the  questions related to activities and devices were dichotomously coded (1 for  presence of response, and 0 for no response). We used nonparametric Phi test to  examine the strength of the correlations between the device and activities  variables (see Table 3). We only report on medium and large correlations (Phi &ge;  .2).</p>

  <p>The correlation statistics suggest  that an information device most frequently associated with reading print  materials is the book, followed by printouts, magazines and newspapers. The most  frequently mentioned device associated with reading electronic texts was the smartphone,  followed by the e-reader, and the iPad. Smartphone ownership was also  associated with a number of other activities, such as emailing, texting, and  playing games. In fact, playing games had higher correlation with the ownership  of a smartphone than a gaming device; and reading electronic texts had higher  correlations with smartphones than specialized e-reading devices.<br />
We were interested to see whether there  are relationships between the amount of time respondents spend commuting and  their preferences for information devices and activities. We ran multiple  regressions to examine how much variance of the commute time can be explained  by the type of devices commuters carry and the types of activities they are  engaged in. The regression model was statistically significant, but explained  only 14% of the commute time variance (<em>R2</em> = .142, <em>F</em>(21,  438) = 3.454, <em>p</em> = .000 at 95% confidence interval). Sleeping during  commute was the strongest predictor of commute time, <em>&beta;</em> = .187, <em>t</em> = 3.905, <em>p</em> = .000, followed by resting, with <em>&beta;</em> = .121, <em>t</em> =  2.420, <em>p</em> = .016.</p>
</div>
<p> We also examined relationships  between demographic variables, the types of devices respondents reported  carrying and the types of activities they engaged in. We were interested to see  whether ownership of certain devices or preferences for certain activities were  associated with representatives of a particular population. We ran multiple  regressions on commuters' age and their information devices and activities. The  model explained about 17% of the age variance (<em>R2</em> = .167, <em>F</em>(21,  437) = 4.174, <em>p</em> = .000 at 95% confidence interval). Listening to music  was the strongest predictor of age, <em>&beta;</em> =- .225, <em>t</em> = 3.938, <em>p</em> = .000, suggesting that this activity was associated with younger commuters. We  have to note that in this and other tests we chose not to interpret other  independent variables' betas due to their relatively small size, even when they  were statistically significant.</p>
<p>  The identified correlations are  illustrated in the Figure 10 below, where information activities are associated  with 1) specific types of devices (e.g. electronic texts&rsquo; reading is associated  with smartphones); 2) commuters&rsquo; demographic characteristics (e.g. music listening  is associated with the younger commuters); and 3) commute time (e.g. the longer  the commute, the more likely commuter will be resting or sleeping).<br />

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The study has explored the  information behaviour of New York City subway commuters. The data for the study  was collected through observations, interviews, and an electronic survey and  analysed using a number of qualitative and quantitative techniques.<br />
  Our analysis identified several  overarching themes, some of which were supported by prior research (Akesson  &amp; Nilsson 2002, Flamm 2005, Brossard <em>et  al.</em> 2009), while others were unique to our study. One of our significant  findings is that information activities of travellers fall into several  categories related to the level of engagement with the activity, and the  situational factors influencing that activity.</p>
<p><br />
  We have classified the commuters'  activities into two groups: </p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Active: activities that involve constant       back-and-forth interaction with the information medium, including: </li>
</ol>
<p>a. reading <br />
  b. emailing, texting, calling <br />

<p><br />
  One of the reasons for avoiding a  more detailed classification (e.g. classifying work-related and entertainment  activities) is linked to the type of data collected. For example, by observing  the travellers, we were not in a position to conclusively determine the intent  of using an information device, even though, in some instances, we were able to  speculate about the intended use (e.g. a fiction book is most likely read for  entertainment purposes). Information behaviour categories identified in our  study are discussed below. In addition to describing commuters' active and  passive activities, we discuss the factors that influence (or might influence)  them. </p>
<h3>Active activities</h3>
<h4>Reading</h4>
<p>One of the most frequently observed  and self-reported activities during commute was reading. The reasons for  popularity of reading on New York City subway are outlined in Mainland (2009),  who suggests that the subway commute offers a time of quiet and solitude, and  that many travellers prefer to use this time productively (also supported by  Grassi <em>et al.</em> 2010) Some of the  commuters interviewed by Mainland (2009) reported studying dense religious  texts, or studying acting sides, others reported using the time to read texts  for entertainment purposes. Similar to the Mainland (2009) observations, our  study confirmed the fondness New York commuters have for reading books,  printouts, and electronic texts on e-readers, and other devices.<br />
  </p>
<p>Books and smartphones were the most  frequently observed and self-reported devices used during the commute. The  phenomenon of traditional book readership on the subway warrants further, more  detailed investigation. On the one hand, books are relatively heavy and bulky  items to carry, compared with alternative devices for reading print and  electronic formats, notably multipurpose devices like the smartphones and  e-readers. On the other hand, books are inexpensive, can be borrowed, are  independent from the availability of the wireless service or electrical power source,  and some users may prefer their physical dimensions, etc. Future studies might  investigate specific reasons for the popularity of books, as well as  opportunities for information institutions to better satisfy commuters' reading  needs, such as the book vending kiosks installed on some of the train stations  in California (Kantor-Horning 2009).<br />
  </p>
<p>A slightly higher percent of  self-reported book use compared to the observation data can be attributed to  the limitations of the survey instrument that was primarily distributed to the  Library and Information Science community and associates. Higher book reading  numbers in the survey might suggest that this community is more involved in  book reading than other populations; the numbers might also reflect the bias of  self-reporting since people might think of book reading as one of the  activities that improves their image, and consequently over-report it.<br />
  </p>
<p>In addition to books, other types of  traditional media used for reading on a subway are newspapers, magazines and  printouts. We observed that the use of these media is relatively low and varies  during different times of the day. For example, newspaper reading during the  morning hours can be correlated to commuters' habit to read their news in the  morning (Readership Institute of Northwestern University 2002) and the distribution  of free publications during the morning rush hour (e.g. Metro-New York. Reading  from printouts or photocopies goes up at midday and slowly drops at later  hours. It is very likely that printout is a medium that offers work-related  information and the need for this type of information emerges during business  hours. Future investigations would require the use of qualitative techniques  for understanding the patterns of print media use throughout the day.<br />
  </p>
<p>The most frequently observed  electronic device used on a subway was the smartphone. This finding can be  related to the high ownership of smartphones: according to Nielsen (2010), 28  percent of American wireless subscribers had smartphones as of the third  quarter of 2010, and it is estimated that in one year that number will double.  In addition, the smartphone&rsquo;s multipurpose functionality and portability allows  for various activities. A young professional interviewed on an above ground  train said that she uses her iPhone for browsing the Web, reading PDFs, writing,  and responding to emails, and occasionally watching videos, and listening to  music. She states that she does not &lsquo;want to carry around more than I have to&rsquo;.  Another commuter we observed was bent over her iPhone with furrowed brow  reading a document on the small screen. When asked if she would consider ever  using a specific electronic reader device she conceded that an iPad may be  nice, but that her smartphone worked fine for now. With wider market  penetration of smartphones and addition of wireless service, we hypothesize  that in the near future, the number of smartphones uses on the New York City subways  will increase.<br />
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our statistical analysis of the  survey data highlights a preference for reading electronic texts from  smartphones rather than specialized e-reading devices. We observed a relatively  low number of e-readers and iPads that were used for reading electronic texts.  This observation might reflect a relatively low market penetration of such  devices, even among &lsquo;sophisticated&rsquo; consumers like New Yorkers. One of the  interviewed commuters noted that he was hesitant to carry expensive devices  like iPads and e-readers for fear they would be stolen. It would be interesting  to investigate the distribution of e-readers and iPads among subway commuters  in the future, when those devices become cheaper and more available and as  readers develop new habits for reading media.</p>
<h4>Emailing, texting, calling</h4>
<p>In addition to reading, texting,  emailing and calling require active attention. All of these activities were  associated with smartphones and availability of wireless service which is  currently limited to above ground trains. The interview data and our accidental  observations of commuters' information devices (e.g. a glance at a laptop  screen) also suggest that commuters engage in scheduling tasks, work-related  activities (e.g. working on spreadsheets), writing and taking notes. We did not  collect sufficient data about these tasks to draw any conclusions about their  role in commuters' behaviour. Future studies might investigate what devices are  preferred for work-related tasks, during what times of the day are commuters  more likely to work on their information devices, and whether commuters  consider engaging in these tasks an unpleasant necessity for catching up with work  or an enjoyable use of their travel time.</p>
<h4>Gaming</h4>
<p>While playing games is usually  associated with entertainment or relaxation, we classified it under active activities  since playing a game requires constant interaction with information media. Both  the survey and observation data indicate that the majority of games played  during commute are on smartphones or similar multi-function devices. Survey  respondents reported playing games during commute (28.8%), but very few  reported owning gaming devices (3.7%). The gaming capabilities of the last few  generations of smartphone are almost on par with the Nintendo DS and allow the  commuter to carry fewer devices. It is also possible that gaming on a mobile  device that has more <em>grown up</em> uses  makes commuters feel more mature or perhaps less embarrassed than they would  feel using dedicated game machines in front of their peers. Games for  smartphones tend to be much cheaper, often costing $1 US but in most cases less  than $5. Games for Nintendo DSi and Sony PSP tend to cost between $20 and $30  US (Amazon, n.d.). While playing games offers an engaging alternative to  passing travel time, it might require certain environmental conditions, such as  availability of seating to free both hands for handing the device. Future  studies might focus on examining the relationships between those factors as  well as exploring demographic characteristics of subway gamers. Some of the  observed gamers, e.g. a middle-aged well-dressed woman, did not meet a typical  gamer stereotype suggesting that, perhaps, commute offers a unique anonymous  environment that accommodates identity changes (Blumen 2000).</p>
<h3>Passive activities</h3>
<p>While reading, along with writing  emails, texting, calling, playing games and other activities are all  industrious activities, certain commuters' activities are more passive in  nature. Listening to music and not interacting with any devices are the  activities we classified as passive.</p>
<h4>Music</h4>
<p>Listening to music is a popular form  of entertainment for commuters. It was the most frequently observed activity  (as inferred from the presence of headphones, Table 4 in Appendix A); it was  the second most frequently reported activity from the survey (Figure 7). One of  our interviewees who reported listening to music on a train did not seem to  consider listening to her iPod as an active activity, but rather part of the  commuter background experience. Listening to music is an effortless activity  and could be related to the need to create personal space in an environment  that otherwise does not have any.<br />
  </p>
<p>Another possible explanation for the  popularity of music on the subway is that this activity can be pursued in  parallel with other activities. During our observations, we noticed some  commuters had headphones on while using their smartphones for reading or typing  of text messages or emails, or reading print material while listening to music.  Interviewed passengers have reiterated that listening to music is a common and  constant activity.<br />
  </p>
<p>Through our analysis, we discovered  some interesting patterns in the relationships between music listening and  commuters' demographic characteristics. Specifically, we found that music  listening was associated with the younger, lower income and lower education  levels among the commuters (as outlined in Results). Future work can focus on  investigating this correlation which might be linked to age-related  preferences, availability of free time, convenience and cost (some of these  devices might have been received for free with the purchase of &lsquo;Back to school&rsquo;  computers (Student buying guide 2010). Most smartphones store music and have  applications for online radio, but standalone devices that play music are also  prevalent and relatively inexpensive. Another explanation for the popularity of  music devices among children, young adults, and college age students could be  peer pressure. Similar pressures might exist for older higher-paid  professionals who might be expected to carry e-readers, tablets, smartphones,  and laptops by their community. Future work might focus on investigating  commuters demographic and socio-cultural differences in relations to  information devices and activities.</p>
<h4>Resting</h4>
<p>The majority of the observed  commuters (53.7%) did not use any information devices while commuting. Our  survey responses reported resting 46.6%, sleeping 20%, or observing other  people 74.9% as activities in which they engaged most of the time. All of these  activities can be classified as passive. Our analysis indicated that rest and  sleeping were related to the length of the commute: the longer our respondents travelled,  the more likely they were to rest or sleep. Choosing to relax instead of  interacting with information devices might be related to the commuters'  personality types, lack of ownership of various information devices, their  vocations (e.g. the desire to relax after a busy day at work), length of  commute, the time of the day (e.g. feeling sleepy during early-morning or  late-night commute, rush hour or crowding of the train), and other factors. All  these questions can be considered in the future studies.</p>
<h3>Role of environmental  conditions</h3>
<h4>Time of day</h4>
<p>Time of day and crowding of the  train were reported as directly influencing the information activities of  commuters. Newspaper reading is most affected by time of day, with a  significant increase in the morning hours (Figure 4). Information and news are  time-sensitive, and newspapers have high availability in the morning hours.  This availability and convenience influence use. Interview data also suggest a  desire for news in the morning as preparation for the day.<br />
  </p>
<p>In the late evening hours, a  significant increase in passive activities was observed, suggesting that people  are tired or are less focused on active activities such as reading and writing.  Listening to music and doing nothing are passive activities that increase late into  the night.</p>
<h4>Travel conditions</h4>
<p>Rush hours and crowding of the train  are influential in the type of activity commuters pursued. According to our  survey results, 72.6% of respondents are heavily influenced by crowding  relative to what device they use while commuting, and a high proportion of <em>Other</em> fill in responses indicated that  if a commuter cannot find a seat on the train that would also influence behaviour  and choice of device. </p>
<p>Crowding is likely to reduce activities that require two  hands or the need to spread out. One may be less inclined to read a book, or a  newspaper in a crowded situation. It is also less likely that commuters would  use expensive devices like e-readers, tablets, and laptops as crowding may  heavily influence the likelihood of devices being stolen. Passive activities  such as listening to music, resting, and observing other people frees  commuters' hands for holding the rails or maintaining their balance on the  moving train.<br />
  </p>
<p>During all of our observations we  noted that the subway cars were adequately lit. Survey respondents did not  identify lighting as a factor that influences what they do on a train, making  us believe that lighting on subway trains is adequate for most of the  activities travellers choose to perform.</p>
<h4>Wireless on Board MTA and  AT&amp;T partnership</h4>
<p>Our research coincides with the New  York City Metropolitan Transit Authority's (MTA) decision to implement an  underground wireless network. On 26 July 2010, Transit Wireless made an  official announcement that they would partner with the MTA to outfit a $200  million dollar wireless network in subway stations. According to Transit  Wireless (You're connected! 2010), 277 stations will support wireless capacity  by 2016. Commuters will be able to use their smartphones and other internet-dependent  wireless devices underground to talk, email and text on the subway platform, and  it is predicted that wireless signal will reach into subway cars.<br />
  </p>
<p>The majority of our survey  respondents thought that the presence of wireless service would change their behaviour;  our observational data supports this. We observed that when wireless service  was available on above ground trains, reading of books or e-readers and  listening to music went down while the use of mobile devices for calling,  reading and texting went up. In order to better understand the effect of  wireless service on information behaviour of subway commuters we would  recommend studying transportation systems where wireless is already available,  such as Boston or Chicago.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A large number of Americans use  public transportation, yet there are very few studies on how commuters use  their travel time. Our study explored information behaviour of New York subway  commuters in order to understand what they do on the train and what information  devices they choose to use. Explorative in nature, our study has identified avenues  for future studies of human information behaviour, changes to city commuting, technology  adoption and use by urban population, and market research.<br />
  </p>
<p>Our study allowed us to classify  commuters&rsquo; activities &nbsp;as either active  or passive, &nbsp;and to explore some of the  factors influencing these activities, including information device ownership, commuters&rsquo;  demographics, time of commute, commute length and environmental conditions. We  found that certain types of activities, such as music listening, calling, and reading  print or electronic media, varied between subway lines. Further investigation  is needed into possible differences between the different subway lines, including  demographics of their riders and communities they connect and availability of  wireless access. We found that frequencies of some activities (e.g. newspaper  reading) varied throughout the day, while frequencies of other activities (e.g.  mobile phone use) did not. This finding suggests existence of time-specific  information tasks and habits (e.g. reading the news in the morning), and  time-neutral tasks and habits (e.g. texting); more work is needed to confirm  this hypothesis. We explored the link between type of activity and demographic  variables and found some correlation (e.g. music listening was associated with  the younger commuters).&nbsp; Future studies  might investigate whether correlation between information activities and  commuters&rsquo; demographics are unique to the subway environment or they represent  the trends of technology use in a general population. We also discovered that  certain activities were influenced by the availability of wireless service  (e.g. mobile calls increased in the above ground trains), length of commute  (longer commute times were associated with higher likelihoods of resting or  sleeping on a train), and crowding.<br />
</p>
<p>Analysis of the information  activities on the New York City subway revealed the popularity of reading and,  specifically, book reading among riders. Considering the availability of  various reading media, books remain an attractive option. Future studies might  investigate the reasons for the popularity of books, including their relatively  low cost, independence from wireless connection and power sources, easy availability,  or entertainment value. Another popular information device was the smartphone.  We found commuters using this device for reading, writing, listening to music,  playing computer games, calling, and other activities. This finding is not  surprising considering portability and multi-functionality of the smartphones.  With the future introduction of wireless service on the MTA lines, we anticipate  that the use of smartphones will increase.<br />
</p>
<p>Along with reading, one of the most  popular activities during the commute was listening to music. Research into  reasons behind the popularity of this passive activity (e.g. for relaxation,  establishment of personal spaces) may merit further investigation. Another  possibly fruitful avenue for future studies is an investigation of the passive  commuters: the majority of commuters who prefer not to use any information  devices and do not engage in any obvious activities (one might argue that a  passive traveller might be busy thinking, resting, actively observing people,  or engaging in other non-observable cognitive activities). It is possible that  no matter what information devices are available to travellers, there will also  be a category of commuters who prefer not to use them. Future research should  consider soliciting commuters' opinions on travel experiences and activity preferences.<br />
</p>
<p>As information technology and  services continue to evolve, so will the commuters' behaviour: introduction of  wireless service will probably increase the number of calls and text messages  from mobile phones and decrease book reading on a subway; improvements in  electronic devices and the decrease in price of e-readers and tablets will increase  their ownership and usage, etc. Based on our findings and their relationships  to prior studies, we also hypothesize that regardless of the technological  landscape, information activities of future travellers will fit into the  underlying fundamental structure of the reviewed models: some commuters will  prefer to use their time productively, while others will prefer to entertain  themselves, or rest. The classification of commuters' activities can be used in  a number of ways. It may inform the design of the in-train information  services; for example, current trains already have commercial and educational  posters (MTA Real Estate Department/Advertising &amp; Telecommunications 2011)  and information screens (PATHVision 2011) that cater to the passive activity travellers.  Public libraries and other information institutions might explore the on-site  landing services, both for physical content as well as digital (e.g. although some  of the subway platforms have commercial newsstands, there is no public library  presence). Certain smartphone applications (similar to the ones discussed in  the Relevant Literature section) might be designed for the large number of  underground smartphone users.</p>
<p>  While our study left a lot of unanswered  questions, we hope that we have laid the groundwork for the future studies of  commuter's information behaviour.</p>

<h2>Appendix E. Description of  observed subway lines </h2>
<p>Observations  were made on lines that run from the Bronx to Brooklyn and from Queens to  Brooklyn, all of which pass through Manhattan and include both the midtown and  downtown districts. Residents of Staten Island who take the Staten Island Ferry  to Manhattan are close to the 6 and 1 trains, which are included in our  observations. Commuters from New Jersey come in via the PATH trains, which  terminate near the N/R/Q trains and the B/D/F trains, which were also observed.  Buses to Port Authority are closest the A/C/E trains and connect via tunnel to  the Times Square station. New Jersey Transit and Amtrak trains terminate at  Penn Station near the 1/2/3 trains. Metro-North trains terminate at Grand  Central Terminal, which is on the 4/5/6 and 7 lines.</p>
