  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>This paper summarises some of the principal findings of a recent study investigation of information usage by
    general medical practitioners (GPs) (<a href="#wood2">Wood et al., 1995a</a>). The work was based on previous
    studies of the value and impact of information, these studies being undertaken in the corporate sector in Canada (<a
      href="#mars2">Marshall, 1993</a>) and in the health care sector in both the USA (<a href="#king">King, 1987</a>;
    <a href="#mars1">Marshall, 1992</a>) and the UK (<a href="#hepw">Hepworth and Urquhart, 1995</a>; Wood et al.,
    1995b, 1996). The study used a critical incident technique similar to that employed in the Canadian and USA studies.
    Twenty seven in-depth interviews were conducted with general practitioners (GPs) in the Trent Health Region (only
    one from each practice). The sample, selected from two health districts, included large, medium and small practices,
    fund-holding and non-fund-holding practices, and training and non-training practices, with some representation of
    those located in deprived and non-deprived (socio-economic) areas.</p>
  <p>The clinical study of <a href="#mars1">Marshall (1992)</a> focused on hospital physicians who have ready access to
    their organisations? special libraries, which is not the case with general practitioners in the United Kingdom. It
    was known from previous studies <a href="#wood2">(Wood et al., 1995b)</a> that GPs were likely to make little direct
    use of libraries in their patient-related decision-making so a much broader approach was taken. It was, however, a
    requirement of the project that the interview schedule incorporate certain of the questions included in earlier
    studies (<a href="#mars1">Marshall, 1992</a>, <a href="#mars2">1993</a>), to allow comparisons to be made with them.
    These comparisons related specifically to three areas: the quality of the information; its cognitive value; and its
    value in the decision-making process. Details of GPs? general use of libraries were gathered separately.</p>
  <h2 id="characteristics-of-the-participants-and-the-critical-incidents">Characteristics of the participants and the
    critical incidents</h2>
  <p>Of the 120 practices contacted 38 expressed willingness to participate. Lack of time was the most common reason
    given for non-participation, although some GPs stated that they had decided not to participate in further studies,
    and several others would have taken part had a financial incentive been offered. The participants varied greatly in
    the length of their professional experience: seven of them had been in practice for less than 5 years; four for 5-10
    years; seven for 11-15 years; and the remaining nine for between 16 and 30 years.</p>
  <p>The participants were required to state the last time they had sought information to assist in the decision-making
    process related specifically to a patient care problem. In fourteen of the cases, the information had been required
    less than one week before; in eight it had been required one to two weeks before, and in one it had been required
    upto one month before. The remaining four GPs based their responses on information sought more than one month
    previously, but it is likely that they had misunderstood what was meant by ?information?, since: one stated during
    the course of the interview that she had telephoned a Regional Medical Officer the previous day; one reads
    extensively and is involved in the area?s Vocational Training Scheme; one rang an Orthopaedist the afternoon of the
    interview for advice about a patient; and the last uses MIMS ((Monthly Index of Medical Specialities) “very
    regularly”. Several GPs commented that they needed information most frequently about drugs, with MIMS, the ABPI Data
    Compendium or the BNF (British National Formulary) being consulted. These were generally considered to be excellent,
    regularly-updated sources but there is no single, standard reference source for drug information.</p>
  <p>GPs were asked to give details of the patient problem presented and the specific types of information sought, as
    detailed in Table 1. When the interviews were analysed it was found that in seven cases, although the information
    was important for patient care, it was not related to clinical decisions but was of an administrative nature. These
    cases are discussed later in the paper.</p>

  <p>The next table, Table 2, shows the sources used to find the information that was used in clinical decision-making.
    In summary, thirteen of the responses involved internal (reference books: 5; GPs? own reading: 4; and internal
    colleagues: 4) information sources and fourteen involved external (external colleagues: 9; laboratory tests or
    results: 2; hospital staff for medical records: 1; X-ray results: 1; and a training course: 1) information sources.
    No use was made of external library services to assist in these decision-making situations, although one GP did use
    the practice library to consult a medical text book.</p>

  <p>Earlier studies (Marshall, 1992, 1993) have investigated the impact of information provided by special libraries in
    the clinical and corporate settings. However, for reasons that have been discussed already, this study concentrated
    on the information sought by the GP himself (herself) from a pertinent source of his or her choosing.</p>
  <p>All except one of the GPs were satisfied with the quality of the information, which was otherwise considered to be
    relevant, accurate and current. The one GP who was not satisfied with the relevancy of the information was unsure of
    the accuracy of the television program his patient had been watching, which had stimulated her enquiry.
    Approximately two thirds of the participants considered that the information had cognitive value in the terms used
    in this study. Almost all GPs agreed that the information did contribute to quality patient care; of those who were
    not satisfied one made the following remarks:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“…they told me that there was absolutely nothing they could do or suggest, and nothing that I could do that would
      make things any better. So it was really a very mechanistic approach which was of no use to me whatsoever in
      managing my patient. Anything I suggested they said wouldn?t work, so it was extremely negative.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Fewer than half of the participants stated that the information saved time. In many cases the process of accessing
    the relevant information was time-consuming; once the information was to hand most of the GPs were able to make the
    appropriate decisions and some stated that it would save time in the future. The answers to this question were
    strongly influenced by the GPs? willingness, or otherwise, to delegate the information-seeking task; only two
    participants had delegated the task to practice staff, with both of these tasks being requests for the results of
    laboratory tests.</p>
  <h4 id="impact-on-decision-making-was-the-situation-handled-differently">Impact on decision-making: was the situation
    handled differently?</h4>
  <p>These data represent the measurable impact of the information; the GP might have felt more confident having
    received the information but a more significant aspect is the extent to which the situation was handled differently.
    Of the 20 GPs, the responses were as follows: definitely yes: 12; probably yes: 2; probably no: 3; definitely no: 3.
    The information thus had an influence on the GP?s handling of the situation in no less than 14 of the 20 cases; of
    these 14, four GPs said the changes were of some importance to the patient, six of considerable importance and four
    of great importance.</p>
  <h4 id="impact-of-the-information-changes-in-patient-care.">Impact of the information: changes in patient care.</h4>
  <p>The most important elements in an impact study are whether the information actually makes a difference to the
    decisions made and whether it allows the recipient to advance the process more effectively. The next table (Table
    4), which is adapted from that used in the Rochester (USA) study (Marshall, 1992), details the changes reported by
    the 14 GPs who reported that the information had brought about a change in the handling of the patient. The results
    show the GPs were able to provide better patient care because of the information. Three GPs changed two aspects of
    patient care and seven changed one aspect of care.</p>

  <h4 id="importance-of-the-availability-of-different-information-sources">Importance of the availability of different
    information sources</h4>
  <p><a href="#table2">Table 2</a> illustrates the variety of information sources used by the GPs in the decision-making
    situation. Seventeen used one source only to satisfy the information need, one used two different sources and two
    GPs used four sources. Colleagues, both within and outside of the Practice, were the most popular sources of
    information. The most frequently used sources of ?internal? information were the BNF, ABPI and MIMS that offer
    drug-related information.</p>
  <p>In this impact study none of the respondents had sought information from an external medical library but one GP had
    referred to his practice library. The general use of libraries by GPs was investigated and this is considered
    further below.</p>
  <h4 id="the-impact-of-non-medical-information">The Impact Of Non-Medical Information</h4>
  <p>Seven of the critical incidents described proved to be concerned with seeking administrative information and did
    not involve any clinical decision-making. Of these, five incidents required details of hospital referral systems
    (four of them for urgent referrals) from hospital staff, one required the availability of a particular drug at a
    particular pharmacy from the pharmacist, and one required a Social Services protocol for admission to a home from
    the duty officer. Only one GP delegated the task of obtaining information for hospital referrals to the practice
    staff.</p>
  <p>The major impact of the non-medical information was in its contribution to higher quality care, with three GPs
    stating that the information was instrumental in enabling the patient to recover more quickly. This serves to
    illustrate the importance of, and necessity for, quality procedural information to accompany quality medical
    information (Table 6).</p>

  <p>In considering whether the situation was handled differently, the majority opinion was in the negative and as such
    it probably reflected the fact that the medical decision had already been made. The three GPs who had handled (or
    would handle) the situation differently each stated that the changes were of considerable importance for the
    patient, e.g.: “<em>it brought his appointment forward by ten, eleven weeks</em>”</p>
  <p>Ready access to such non-medical information is of vital importance to the GP?s management of the case.</p>
  <h3 id="gps-use-of-external-library-sources">GPs? use of external library sources</h3>
  <p>One of the participants remarked that: “general practitioners hardly ever visit libraries, they don?t get lots of
    other publications except maybe the BMJ, and other journals because they?re free”</p>
  <p>reflecting the findings of previous studies (<a href="#chil">Childs, 1988</a>; <a href="#elay">Elayyan, 1988</a>).
    GPs do not use a library for immediate patient care problems but the majority (26 of the 27 participants) stated
    that they read the British Medical Journal (BMJ). It would appear that the library is considered to be a collection
    of books and journals to be accessed when the GP has time, rather than as an information service.</p>
  <p>All GPs in this study were asked to state the last time that they had used an external library in connection with
    their work. Of the twelve GPs who had used an external library within the previous six months: seven had used
    hospital medical libraries; three the Post-graduate Centres attached to hospitals; one the Health Authority library;
    and one the RCGP library. The librarian was involved in obtaining information in six cases, one of which was to
    arrange a CD-ROM training session and two were related to telephone requests. Nine GPs visited the library, two
    telephoned, and one sent a postal enquiry. The GPs sought: CD-ROM training; literature searches for new titles; and
    medical literature searches related to a non-urgent patient case, related to litigation, in preparation for a talk,
    for writing a paper, and for researching a project.</p>
  <p>None of the examples of library use was directly related to an immediate patient problem; some were in connection
    with the treatment of specific illnesses, some with continuing education and some with research. Contact with the
    library was rated as ?Very successful? by six GPs and ?Successful? by a further six GPs. An additional three GPs had
    used library services within the previous twelve months, one when he was studying for an examination, one for the
    purposes of post-graduate education, and one in connection with an audit he was conducting. The availability of an
    efficient, effective external library service is obviously highly valued by some GPs. “<em>One of the best things
      for me is having contact with libraries.</em>”</p>
  <p>One interesting comment from a participant was:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“I only use it (the library) occasionally, so…I don?t know my way around…and I?m conscious of (a) not appearing
      an idiot and (b) taking up…the librarian?s time…It would be…good to ring somebody up in the library and say”Can
      you dig me out a few bits and pieces on..“…you?d be really grateful and possibly willing to pay for it”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Several of the participants who had not used an external library in connection with their work during the previous
    six months were avid readers of journals, had outside interests and were keen on information technology in medicine.
    Physical access to the nearest medical library, especially parking, was regarded as a major problem by several GPs.
  </p>
  <p>Seventeen of the GPs were members of the BMA; of these, only one mentioned using the BMA library and now prefers to
    use the CD-ROM version of MEDLINE. Eighteen were members of the RCGP but only one GP mentioned using their library
    recently and one stated that membership was “not that useful”. When speaking about their reading habits GPs used
    terminology such as ?indulgence?, ?privileges?, and reading and discussing in ?protected time?. This choice of
    language may reflect the view that the opportunity for reading is regarded as a luxury, rather than an integral part
    of a GP?s working day.</p>
  <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
  <p>In this study the GPs were asked to describe the last time they had needed to seek information to help with the
    care of a patient. Almost all could describe an event within the last week, e.g., finding out the arrangements for a
    particular referral, checking on the most suitable drug for a child, reviewing a case, checking if a patient had to
    come off particular medication prior to an operation. Sometimes the information was needed whilst the patient was
    with the GP. The information was obtained mainly by telephoning hospital staff, including consultants, but other
    sources included MIMS, drug compendia, the practice library, meetings and colleagues. In about two-thirds of the
    cases the information obtained changed the way the situation was handled. In about one-third of cases, the
    information obtained changed the choice of tests, drugs, post-hospital care, or advice given to the patient.</p>
  <p>In a few cases the actual diagnosis was changed because of the information obtained. In some cases GPs also
    reported that the information they obtained meant that they did not send the patient for additional tests or other
    procedures, refer the patient to a consultant, or arrange hospital admission. Over half the GPs said that the health
    status of the patient had improved when it otherwise might not have done. A few of the GPs said that the patient
    recovered when s/he might not have done or that the patient recovered more quickly (this was related to non-medical
    information).</p>
  <p>Information is often needed immediately for individual patient care. Already some GP computer systems include a
    drug compendium which contains information on adverse reactions and contra- indications. Computer-based information
    systems, such as Personalised Medical Reference (<a href="#mcmo">McMorran et al., 1995</a>) which aims to
    encapsulate essential medical knowledge and the Oxford Handbook of Medicine, will become more generally available
    but the extent to which the contents of these are research based will vary. Some GPs may choose also to have MEDLINE
    or other databases on CD-ROM in the practice or to access MEDLINE via the BMA but will still need the services of
    librarians to enable them to learn effective searching strategies and to obtain documents.</p>
  <p>For some of the critical incidents, evidence-based or research-based information was not needed but for others
    evidence of medical, drug, or care provider performance was required. It appears, however, that few of the GPs
    directly used such information although the consultants, and other hospital staff consulted by the GPs, could have
    been basing their advice on published research or other evidence. For this reason additional questions were asked
    about the GPs? use of information sources. When asked to consider the importance of sources of information over half
    the GPs considered colleagues in hospitals important. Other GPs considered reference books, their own colleagues,
    reading and courses/meetings as important. The only journal which was read by almost all the GPs was the BMJ. The
    only other publications most of the GPs said they saw or read were books, free publications and drug company
    leaflets. A few had carried out a MEDLINE search or had one done for them. Practice libraries, where they existed,
    appeared to be well used, especially for looking at journals.</p>
  <p>As these results show, human sources were considered to be more important than literary sources in the context of
    immediate patient care problems. In the six months prior to the study less than half of the GPs had used a medical
    library, other than their practice library, and seven had not used an external library for many years. Physical
    access to those libraries attached to hospitals was a problem in several cases; this may be improved with
    technological changes, although some GPs were concerned about the lack of computer capacity to avail themselves of
    such services. GPs do use libraries for research, continuing education and non-immediate reasons, but there seems to
    be a lack of awareness of exactly what services are available, and in some cases a lack of knowledge of how to use
    those services. The service offered by the Sheffield Health Authority in circulating the details of new publications
    is commendable, but only one of the participants in this study availed himself of it. More GPs are entitled to
    access the libraries and information services of the BMA and RCGP than use them.</p>
