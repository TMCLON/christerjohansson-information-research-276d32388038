<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Preparation of the this issue of the journal has been a little fraught, mainly the result of my travelling to Bor√•s shortly before publication date and leaving some of the files behind in Sheffield!  Consequently, the book reviews, although they exist won't be found by clicking on the relevant link until 21st September, when I am back in the UK.  Also, the author and subject indexes will not be updated until then.</p>

<p>The problems have not prevented us from putting together another substantial issue, with a variety of papers.  The subjects range from information sharing (on which there are a couple of papers), to immigrants in the USA and banana farmers in Uganda.  Not surprisingly, such a range is the result of authors from a variety of countries: Australia, Canada, China, Finland, Lithuania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Uganda, and the USA.  Some of the papers result from international collaborations, e.g., Sweden and Lithuania, Singapore and China, and, as concern for research problems becomes more global, I imagine we will see an increse in such collaborations, over time.  That has certainly happened in certain branches of science, most notably, perhaps, in genomics and, of course, in Europe, is encouraged by participation in the EU's research programmes.</p>

<p>An interesting question for the Editorial Team is, Why do some authors favour the journal, while others appear only once on our contents page and are never heard of again?  I imagine that one of the reasons is that some established authors are highly productive and spread their papers around a number of journals, while others are publishing, perhaps, the results of doctoral research and may move out of the field into institutional management jobs, or may shift their interests, once they are in teaching positions, where a nich journal may be more relevant for their output.   If you have other answers to the question, do let me know!</p>

<h2> Book reviews</h2>

<p>The summer, which we will shortly officially enter, is usually a fairly quiet month for new publications, as the publishers rev themselves up for the autumn and Christmas markets.  As a result, we have fewer reviews than usual, but, again, there is quite a wide variety.</p>

<h2>Lastly</h2>
                 
<p>The call for copy-editors resulted in an excellent group who are now working for the journal, alongside the more established members of the team, we are very grateful to all of them for their excellent work.  We alos thank our referees, who help to ensure the quality of the journal&mdash;whatever the JCR reports!</p>

<p>The registration process, whereby readers could sign up to be notified about new issues has now been closed.  There are several reasons for this: the fact that Lund University Libraries, which hosts the journal, will be moving it to a new server, but also we faced an increasing problem of spammers signing up to the journal - just before my final mailing, I counted at least fifty such fake readers and it simply isn't worth the bother of removing them all.</p>

<p>Of course, we'll continue posting to the various mailing lists to announce new issues and our regular readers are also, most probably, subscribers to at least one of those lists.</p>
