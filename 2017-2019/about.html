 <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
 
<p>Information Research is a freely available, international, scholarly journal, dedicated to making accessible the results of research across a wide range of information-related disciplines. It was established in 1995 by Professor T.D. Wilson, Professor Emeritus of the University of Sheffield and subsequently Senior Professor, University of Borås. It is now published by the Swedish School of Library and Information Science, University of Borås, Sweden, with technical support from Lund University Libraries, Sweden.</p>

<p>The journal is indexed by</p>

<p>The journal is listed in the catalogues and directories of resources of several hundred university and college libraries around the world and in the major Internet searching tools.</p>

<h2 id="edpol">Editorial policy</h2>

<p>Information Research publishes refereed papers in the fields of information science, information management, information systems, information policy, archives and records management and librarianship.</p>

<p>Papers, reporting original research, should be of 7,000 to 8,000 words, and should be submitted through the <a href="http://nile.lub.lu.se/ojs/index.php/infores/login?source=%2Fojs%2Findex.php%2Finfores%2Fuser" target="_blank">journal management system Website</a> according to the instructions found there (if an author experiences problems, he or she should contact the Editor). Each paper should be submitted with a structured abstract, using the <a href="http://informationr.net/ir/IRWordTemplate.doc">Word template</a> provided, and with the figures as separate .gif or .jpg files.</p>

<p>All papers are submitted to referees who are acknowledged authorities in the various fields of specialisation of the journal. A 'double-blind' review process is used, requiring authors to remove any indication of identity from their papers before submitting. Where referees disagree over the quality of a submitted paper, the Editor will obtain an opinion from a third referee.</p>

<p><em>Information Research</em> also publishes book reviews.</p> 

<p>The journal does not levy any author charges for publication of papers, nor is there a submission charge. If an author is unable to provide an html file a conversion can be provided by the publisher for a fee of £50, or the equivalent in other currencies plus £8.00 to cover bank charges.</p>

<h2 id="accpol">Access policy</h2>

<p>Drawing upon Peter Suber's suggestion that all journals should state their access policy clearly, our answers to his questions are given below:</p>

<p>1. What kinds of content, if any, do you offer online free of charge? &mdash; <em>All journal content is offered online, free of charge, with no payment for publication ("article processing charges") or for access.</em></p>

<p>2. Do you allow authors to deposit their postprints in OA repositories? &mdash; <em>Yes. No restriction of any kind is placed upon the author's subsequent use of a paper, since copyright is retained by the author.</em></p>

<p>3. Do you refuse to consider submissions that have circulated as preprints? &mdash; <em>No. Only papers that have been formally published elsewhere in either a journal or a published conference proceedings are considered ineligible.</em></p>

<p>4. What permissions do you give for the use of your content? &mdash; <em>No permission is required for any non-commercial re-use, since the copyright rests with the author. Commercial re-use requires the permission of the author and of the Editor, and charges will be made for such re-use.</em></p>

<p>4.1 Do you allow the author to distribute copies of the postprint to students and colleagues? &mdash; <em>Yes</em></p>

<p>4.2 Do you allow all teachers to distribute copies to students? &mdash; <em>Yes</em></p>

<p>4.3 Do you allow authors, without further permission, to use their work in presentations and subsequent publications?  &mdash; <em>Yes</em></p>

<p>4.4 For your free online content, do you allow:<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...commercial reuse? &mdash; <em>No</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...derivative works? &mdash; <em>No</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...copying of individual articles? &mdash; <em>Yes - for non-commercial use.</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...mirroring of larger collections, or LOCKSS-style preservation? &mdash; <em>Yes</em></p>

<p>5. What rights do you require that authors transfer to you? &mdash; <em>None. Authors retain all rights in their work.</em></p>

<p>6. Do libraries have the right of permanent access to subscribed issues (to your copies or their own) after their subscriptions lapse? If so, do libraries have the right to migrate the files to new formats or new media to keep them readable as technology changes? &mdash; <em>The journal is freely available, without subscription: libraries have the right of access to the entire journal content at any time.</em></p>

<p>7. Do you open your digital files for crawling by knowledge-integrating and question-answering AI?  &mdash; <em>Yes</em></p>

<h2 id="peerev">The peer review process</h2>

<p>All papers undergo a double-blind review process, which requires that the author removes from the paper any indication of identity—see the <a href="../author2.html">Author Instructions</a> on this. Papers are first reviewed one of the Regional Editors and, if it is considered to be within the scope of the journal and of appropriate quality, it is then circulated to two referees, selected for their expertise in the area of the submitted paper. Members of the Editorial Board act as referees, where appropriate. Refereed papers, in other words, will be subject to the full rigour of peer review as it is exercised by the major scholarly printed journals. The majority of papers submitted usually require revision before publication and, overall, the acceptance rate of the journal is approximately 35% of submitted papers.</p>

<p>The majority of papers are published within a year from the date of submission: the actual time taken depends upon finding appropriate referees (in some cases this has involved three or more attempts), the time they take to respond, and the time the author takes to revise and resubmit the paper. The journal is not restricted by needing to limit its output in any way: an issue may contain only three papers, or it may include fifteen or twenty - 'page limitations' do not affect an electronic journal. However, authors are advised to restrict their paper to 7,000 or 8,000 words, since longer papers put a burden on the reader making it less likely that they will be read. </p>
