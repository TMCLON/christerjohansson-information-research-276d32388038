          <blockquote> <strong>Introduction.</strong> People search for
            information on different search engines billions of times day all
            over the developed world. Not all Web resources are, however,
            equally authoritative and not all searches return equally
            authoritative results. Earlier studies have demonstrated the
            complexity of credibility assessments, but also simultaneously the
            existence of strong tendencies to uncritically accept the
            credibility of the information retrieved by a search engine. The
            success of a search is related, but not the same notion as the
            authority of the results. The aim of this paper is to analyse the
            articulated role of 'searching' as a possible source of cognitive
            authority in Web searching. <br>
            <strong>Method.</strong> A qualitative exploratory study based on
            the analysis of 805 search-related utterances harvested from the Web
            using Webometric Analyst. <br>
            <strong>Analysis.</strong> The data was analysed using constant
            comparative method.<br>
            <strong>Results.</strong> Three types of cognitive authorities were

            <strong>Conclusions.</strong> The findings indicate that searching
            incorporates cognitive authorities that are abstract, exercised and

      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Studies have shown that search engines tend to be the channel of
          choice to information in diverse questions of work and everyday life
          in the developed countries (<a href="paper567.html#Rieh2004">Rieh 2004</a>). In
          spite of their popularity and the giant leaps taken in their design
          and development, both search engines and searching have their limits.
          Not all Web resources are equally authoritative (<a href="paper567.html#Cronin2001">Cronin
            2001</a>) and not all searches return equally authoritative results.
          Investigations of Web search behaviour have evidenced both the
          complexity of credibility assessments (<a href="paper567.html#Wathen2002">Wathen
            &amp; Burkell 2002</a>) and tendencies to uncritical
          acceptance of that what a search engine happens to retrieve (<a href="paper567.html#Pan2007">Pan
            et al.2007</a>). Savolainen (<a href="paper567.html#Savolainen2007b">2007</a>)
          has shown how the selection of information sources is heavily
          influenced by assessments of media credibility and the perceptions of
          cognitive authority (in Wilson's terms, <a href="paper567.html#wilson1983">1983</a>).
          Kuhlthau's (<a href="paper567.html#Kuhlthau2004">2004</a>) information search
          process (ISP) model underlined similarly the role of internal factors
          in information seeking that are more closely related to searcher's
          emotions and anxieties than to the results or explicit evaluative
          judgments. Also Rieh and Hilligoss (<a href="paper567.html#Rieh2007">2007</a>)
          emphasise the strongly contextual nature of authority and credibility
          on the Web. Because of this apparent significance of heuristic rather
          than explicit a posteriori credibility assessments, Taraborelli (<a href="paper567.html#Taraborelli2008">2008</a>)
          has argued that credibility research needs to take a closer look at
          both non-reputational and explicitly reputational cues and biases of
          source evaluation.</p>
        <p>Drawing on the observations of both Taraborelli (<a href="paper567.html#Taraborelli2008">2008</a>)
          and Kuhlthau (<a href="paper567.html#Kuhlthau2004">2004</a>), the present study
          aims to look closer at the perceived cognitive authority and
          credibility of the act of searching information. The aim of this paper
          is to report and discuss the results of an exploratory study of the
          articulation of cognitive authorities in the context of Web searching.
          The study is based on a qualitative analysis of 805 utterances related
          to search engine use harvested from the Web using the Webometric
          Analyst software (<a href="paper567.html#Thelwall2009a">Thelwall 2009</a>). The
          findings provide new information on how and why search engines and
          especially searches are considered and claimed to be authoritative by
          searchers on the Web. The study also presents new insights into the
          contexts of the authority of searching, and provides a new
          understanding of the implications and impact of the assumptions and
          claims of authoritativeness in the information ecology of the
          Internet. The results have implications for the design of search
          systems by augmenting the notion of context of the relevance of
          results (why something is relevant or not, and what are the
          implications of relevance) and by suggesting means to use cognitive
          authority in relevance feedback.</p>
        <h2>Literature overview</h2>
        <p>Traditionally in the information science contexts, the notions of
          credibility, authority and success have been seen as aspects of the
          perceived relevance. Su (<a href="paper567.html#Su1994">1994</a>) compared 20
          different measures of information retrieval success and concluded that
          users tended to be more concerned with recall than precision. In a
          later study, Su (<a href="paper567.html#Su1998">1998</a>) found that the value of
          the results, as a whole is the best measure of success.</p>
        <p>For over a decade, researchers have begun to make a clearer
          distinction between relevance and authoritativeness of information
          sources and channels. Rieh (<a href="paper567.html#Rieh2010">2010</a>) sees the
          growth of the Internet, a massive source of information of varying
          quality, as a major reason for considering credibility and cognitive
          authority as an independent research agenda. When availability is no
          more the principal issue of concern of the information seeker, the
          perceived relevance and preference of particular sources, channels and
          sets of results is increasingly based on factors other than recall and
          topicality, which include those such as media credibility and
          cognitive authority (<a href="paper567.html#Savolainen2007b">Savolainen 2007</a>).
          The mechanisms of judging credibility can also differ between
          different types (i.e., known authorities, independent information
          providers and aggregators of information sources (<a href="paper567.html#Chung2012">Chung
            et al. 2012</a>) and between different cultures (<a href="paper567.html#Yi2012">Yi
            et al.2012</a>). Savolainen and Kari (<a href="paper567.html#Savolainen2006a">2006</a>)
          have identified altogether 18 different relevance criteria in Web
          searching, of which specificity, topicality, familiarity, and variety
          were the most frequently mentioned.</p>
        <p>The notion of cognitive authority was coined by Wilson (<a href="paper567.html#wilson1983">1983</a>)
          to make a distinction between administrative authority (people or
          entities have authority because of their position) and cognitive
          authority (authority based on influence). The two premises of
          cognitive authority are the recognition of expertise and reputation. A
          person has to be expert in a topic and that expertise has to be known
          (i.e., recognised) before the person can function as a cognitive
          authority. Cognitive authority is not, however, restricted to people.
          Also books, journals and institutions have cognitive authority that is
          based on the personal authority of the author of the text,
          institutional authority of the publisher, authoritativeness of the
          type of text and the intrinsic plausibility of the claims made in the
          text (<a href="paper567.html#wilson1983">Wilson 1983</a>).</p>
        <p>During the past decade, there has been a growing interest in the
          notion of cognitive authority, as Rieh (<a href="paper567.html#Rieh2010">2010</a>)
          suggests, because of the rapid growth in the use of Web-based
          information resources. Rieh (<a href="paper567.html#Rieh2002">2002</a>) has studied
          cognitive authority on the Web and developed a Model of Judgment of
          Information Quality and Cognitive Authority that explains how people
          make predictive and evaluative judgments about which Websites contain
          credible information. According to Wathen and Burkell's (<a href="paper567.html#Wathen2002">2002</a>)
          related model of credibility assessment, people make their first
          judgments based on surface characteristics and if a Website seems
          promising, they make a second more in-depth evaluation, on message
          level and thirdly on cognitive level. In practice, people often use
          mental shortcuts and rules when they judge the authoritativeness of a
          text (<a href="paper567.html#Rieh2007">Rieh and Hilligoss 2007</a>; <a href="paper567.html#Rieh2010">Rieh
            2010</a>). The processual and indirect nature of authority judgments
          has also been observed by Taraborelli (<a href="paper567.html#Taraborelli2008">2008</a>).
          He argues that instead of looking at evaluative judgments as in
          earlier studies, it may be more productive to look at a priori
          judgments of authority. Credibility research has shown that, in
          practice, people rely in their information seeking more on simple
          heuristics than on complex calculated evaluations (e.g., <a href="paper567.html#Rieh2007">Rieh
            and Hilligoss 2007</a>).</p>
        <p>Even if it has become customary to study cognitive authority of
          information sources, the processual and contextual dependence of
          cognitive authority judgments may be taken to suggest that, in
          addition to entities like texts, journals and people, cognitive
          authority can reside also in activity. Hargittai et al. (<a href="paper567.html#Hargittai2010">2010</a>)
          show how the search process together with search context, branding and
          routines and social networks play an important role in credibility
          assessments. In the context of known information sources such as
          Wikipedia, the credibility assesments depend also on the assumptions
          and knowledge of the forms of producing information (<a href="paper567.html#Francke2012">Francke
and
            Sundin 2012</a>). Jessen and J&oslash;rgensen (<a href="paper567.html#Jessen2012">2012</a>)
          have developed a model of aggregated credibility on the basis of these
          and other similar findings published in the literature. The model
          underlines the interplay of (external) authorities, social validation
          (by peers using e.g., comments or votes) and profiles (i.e., in online
          services, essentially a known, or perhaps rather claimed, identity).
          Even if the approach addresses the dynamics of credibility, the
          emphasis of Addelson (<a href="paper567.html#Addelson2003">2003</a>) on the active
          nature of cognitive authority and how it is implicitly and explicitly
          exercised in practice instead of being perceived as a static
          characteristic of things, warrants some further discussion. Because of
          its exercised nature, cognitive authority is also dependent on the
          event of exercise. It may be assumed that some instances of exercised
          cognitive authority have more cognitive authority because of the
          people, institutions and other influencers involved. The type and
          characteristics of the event, plausibility of the results and, for
          instance, if known, the effort that was put into producing the
          results, all affect the level and emergence of cognitive authority. </p>
        <h2>Method and material</h2>
        <p>The material for the present study consists of 805 utterances related
          to information searching and search engine use collected from the Web.
          The heuristically generated phrases used in the harvesting of the
          utterances are listed in Table 1. The heuristics was based on an
          in-depth exploration of Web-based discussion forums and blogs to
          discern the patterns of expressing failed and successful searching.
          Each of the chosen expressions was tested by using a Google search
          (http://www.google.com) and overviewing the first ten results for
          their relevance in the present study i.e., whether the utterances were
          related to searching or not. Different wordings (e.g., <em>I searched in
          Internet</em>) were tested and the final selection of utterances was based
          on the number of retrieved hits (phrases with a large number of hits
          were preferred) and their relevance to the topic (phrases with a low
          number of actual Web searching related hits were omitted) in the
          Google search test.</p>
        <p>The data was collected using Webometric Analyst software (<a href="paper567.html#Thelwall2009a">Thelwall
            2009</a>) with the Bing search engine API (<a href="paper567.html#Thelwall2012">Thelwall
            and Sud 2012</a>) in November 2011. The software uses the API of a
          particular search engine to retrieve links to a set of pages
          containing specified phrases. The composition of the sample of
          retrieved links is determined by the search engine and its API. The
          applicability of the method for collecting data on human information
          behaviour has been discussed earlier by Huvila (<a href="paper567.html#Huvila2011b">2011b</a>).
          The Web pages that contained the phrases were analysed using constant
          comparative method (<a href="paper567.html#Glaser1965">Glaser 1965</a>) to discern
          patterns and similarities between the information seeking situations
          and their contexts, and to increase the validity of the analysis. The
          total number of hits returned by Webometric Analyst, the number of
          search-related utterances and valid cases analysed in the present
          study are listed in Table 1. The validity of cases was determined by
          their relevance for the present study i.e., whether the cases could be
          retrieved in the analysis phase (i.e., the page was still available)
          and they were related to search activity. Finally, fifty cases were
          dropped as obvious cases of spam (i.e., identical compliments for
          providing good information with a link to a link farm). The utterances
          were coded and referred in the following according to the information
          'source' mentioned in the phrase (e.g., [G]oogle, [B]ing, [I]nternet,
          [W]eb) together with an index based on the original list of 3006
          utterances.</p>
        <p>Association of Internet Researchers Ethics guidelines (<a href="paper567.html#Ess2002">Ess
            and AoIR Ethics Working Committee 2002</a>) were applied when
          collecting and analysing the data. Because of the personal nature of
          many utterances (even if they are publicly available on the Web), the
          examples from the research data have been chosen with special
          consideration for the original writers of the utterances.</p>

        <h2>Findings</h2>
        <p>The thematic variation of using different phrases for expressing
          search attempts on different topics showed some distinct
          characteristics even if the topical variation did not seem to have a
          strong correlation with the phrasing of the utterances and claims of
          authority (compare for <a href="paper567.html#Huvila2011a">Huvila 2011a</a>).
          Utterances containing references to cars seemed to occur more often
          with phrases containing a named search engine (7/172, 4%) than with
          generic Internet-, Net- or Web-related phrases (10/655, 1,6%). The
          references to the Internet with a mention of a specific search engine
          dominated in food, health, music and programming related utterances.
          In general, the topics ranged from personal questions to education
          (e.g., N490, I192), military aviation (e.g., G537), tractors (e.g., W180)
          and, for instance, cooking (e.g., W363, G489). A qualitative overview
          of the contexts of the utterances gives an impression of a
          geographical variety of the origins of the utterances with countries
          across the English-speaking world and a significant presence of
          non-native speakers. The popularity of the named search engines
          (Google 157 utterances, Yahoo 40, Bing 9) in the utterances is roughly
          similar to the published search engine use statistics.</p>
          
        <p>The different utterances showed varying degrees of the level of
          evaluation of the search results. In terms of the model of credibility
          assessment of Wathen and Burkell (<a href="paper567.html#Wathen2002">2002</a>),
          422/805 (52%) utterances contained indicative evidence of no or at
          most a shallow surface level of evaluation of the results. Some
          searchers seemed to base their evaluation on mere a priori claims that
          a Google search leads to good information by default (e.g., W344, I139)
          while others made a judgment on the basis of "nice"pictures (Y82) or
          by that information "looks serious"(I224). 68/805, (8%) contained
          message level evaluation or utterances on the necessity to evaluate
          the validity of the results. Searchers did, for instance, ask comments
          about the validity of their findings (e.g., G99, Y3), they expressed
          doubts about the relevance of results (e.g., W430, G504), were
          pondering the presence of contradictory (e.g., I102, N751) and similar
          information (e.g., N641, I600), or reflected upon the reviews of a
          particular piece of information (e.g., N7, N280). In 235/805 (29%)
          cases the utterances provide evidence of at least slightly deeper
          cognitive or empirical evaluation of the results. Searchers were
          referring their personal experiences of the relevance and quality of
          the information they had found (e.g., G84, W91), or vice versa, the
          similarity of their own prior experiences and the available
          information (e.g., N510, N707), and complimented bloggers and Web site
          owners on the practical helpfulness of the provided information (e.g.
          B4, I169).</p>
          
        <p>The analysed utterances could also be categorised according to the
          presence of three major sources of authority (Table 2). The categories
          were constructed on the basis of authority claims made in direct
          conjunction to the phrase of utterance. Due to the nature of the
          empirical material, anecdotal secondary references to other
          authorities were recorded but omitted in the final categorisation.</p>

        <p>First, 269/805 (33.4%) utterances contained indications of the
          influence of the people (groups, communities and individual Internet
          users) as an authority. Searchers relied and made claims on the basis
          of the assumed topical expertise and experience of individuals
          (including themselves). Utterances contained requests for comments on
          the authority of found information (e.g., G99, N418), references to
          good reviews (e.g., N7, N280) and expressions of disappointment of the
          presence of bad information provided by reputable communities or
          individuals on the Internet (e.g., N34, G302). One searcher chose a
          travel company because of the number of '<em>good comments</em>' (I206) she
          found. Whereas the positive reputation could function as an authority,
          the lack of reputation was considered to be a sign of its absence: '<em>I
          wonder why you recommend the Qubz drive. I searched on the Web for
          information about it without success</em>' (W17). Some of the utterances
          confirmed the validity of the results of a search or vice versa. For
          instance, searchers might have used a particular service (I206), tried
          the usefulness of the information in practice (I349), or they could
          confirm the information about a location they had visited (N586). On
          the other hand, the similarity to their own earlier experiences or
          symptoms (e.g., N510, N571) could confirm the validity of something the
          searchers had found on the Web. Others were asking for confirmation of
          something they had found on the Web (e.g., N121, I202). A qualitative
          reading of the utterances suggests that a large number of these
          questions are related to safety (e.g., of using something or
          travelling somewhere) and practical reliability of, for instance,
          procedures and devices. Searchers were asking about the dependability
          of, for instance, particular medicines (in the context of health
          related questions) or procedures (technology related questions). In
          some rare cases the authority was named, for instance, '<em>I searched in
          net and even Stephen Hawking [was] not saying much about this</em>' (N234).</p>
          
        <p>Secondly, in 132/805 (16.4%) cases the searchers made claims on the
          usefulness of search engine use (as an approach of becoming informed)
          by making inferences about the credibility of information using a
          series of shortcuts and a priori assumptions. The relevance ranking of
          results in search engines, comparison of results on multiple search
          engines and the presence of confirmatory (i.e., other people had had
          similar problems or the same information could be found in multiple
          sources, e.g., I180, I320, N279) or contradictory information were
          mentioned as shortcuts for making quality judgments on the unfamiliar
          topics. Some searchers mentioned a particular search query (e.g., G224,
          G242, G246, G515) as an authoritative reference to a particular piece
          of information. Trust in the authority of ranking was expressed in
          claims that relevant results 'are' among the first ranked results, but
          also that no out-dated or (subjectively) irrelevant information should
          be found among the top results (e.g., B21, G516). "Before when i
          searched on Bing.com it came up first thing. Not any more. But it will
          eventually find it."(B3) is a strong indication of how the reliance on
          search engines influence information seeking and management practices.
          At the same time it demonstrates the perceived authoritativeness of a
          named search engine not only as a momentary source of unspecific
          useful information, but also as a persistent point to accessing a
          particular piece of information.</p>
          
        <p>A parallel aspect of the prominence of searching as an authority was
          the prevalence of indications of the significance of a priori
          assumptions. One of the most prevalent assumptions was that of the
          intrinsic quality of a particular search engine (e.g., G295) or the
          Internet as a whole as a good source of information (e.g., I535, I853,
          I863, N124, N156, N269, N565, G477) that is both accessible and easy
          to understand (e.g., G426, G476). Some searchers remarked that the
          Internet is a better source of information than certain individuals
          (e.g., mother-in-law in N718) or another type of information source
          (e.g., customer support, G245). In N242, the searcher remarked that the
          Internet is a good source of information for Internet-related matters.
          In B1, the searcher writes: '<em>Naturally, I searched on bing and goog to
          see if anyone had solved these issues</em>'. and in I85 that '<em>Well the next
          day I searched on internet (after-all I am a netizen)</em>'. Utterance I853
          contains an even stronger expression of the validity of information
          found '<em>in the Internet</em>': '<em>i found it[ ]unusual coz i searched in the
          internet and it says that it can only be found in the US</em>'. Another
          common articulation was that if something is not found using a search
          engine, it does not exist, or the contrary, that a hit in a search
          engine is a positive evidence of the veracity of a claim (e.g., N189,
          G383). For instance, '<em>I searched in the Internet right away and cried
          after I found that the news is true</em>' (I884). The same contention
          implies also that it is strange or even suspicious if something is not
          found in the Internet (e.g., G407, G420). Searchers also remarked on
          their experiences of the superiority of particular search engines in
          comparison to others (e.g., B21, Google is better than Bing).</p>
          
        <p>Finally, in 303/805 (37.6%) of cases the searchers appeared to
          consider the search activity itself as an authority. Instead of
          placing explicit trust on their use of a Web search engine as a useful
          tool for retrieving information, the utterances contained descriptions
          how the (implicit or explicit) effort or diversity of performing a
          search implies that the results have to be correct or relevant.
          Similarly, a poorly performed search (as perceived by the searcher)
          was seen as a legitimate reason to question the usefulness or accuracy
          of the results. The most prevalent type of expression that vested
          authority in the search activity were utterances in which searchers
          legitimated their questions by claiming that they had searched but
          failed (e.g., G392, G395, I450) sometimes regretting their poor search
          skills (e.g., G409), or that they were unable to find an additional
          piece of information (e.g., N127, G537). Searcher G260 claimed to have
          been searching for a piece of information '<em>for over 30 minutes</em>'. In
          G453, the searcher described the results of an earlier search attempt
          and promised to provide additional information '<em>if I find more</em>'. The
          veracity of the claims and especially the exhaustiveness of the
          efforts may be doubted when searchers ask simple questions that
          contain all necessary search terms. The positive reactions to the
          expressions of search effort (e.g., G532) and the popularity of the
          custom of legitimating a post containing an answer to a question on a
          discussion forum or a blog by stating that no earlier answers could be
          found (e.g., W12, I177) may be an indication of an assumption of the
          significance of a search as an authoritative act. </p>
          
        <h2>Discussion and conclusions</h2>
        
        <p>Even if the contemporary search engines provide us with certain
          contextual cues, the traditional premiss of a search system as a tool
          for factual retrieval (criticised e.g., by Marchionini <a href="paper567.html#Marchionini2006">2006</a>)
          has not become obsolete. The findings of this study shows that it
          still dominates the minds of the searchers as much as it underpins the
          design of search systems. Even if contextuality has been acknowledged
          for a long time as a fundamental premiss of information seeking and
          credibility assessments (<a href="paper567.html#Rieh2007">Rieh and Hilligoss 2007</a>)
          and higher levels of information literacy (<a href="paper567.html#Alexandersson2005">Alexandersson
            and Limberg 2005</a>), the recurrence of ad hoc articulations (and
          consequent assumptions of their plausibility) of using the Internet as
          a source to check the verity of statements, acontextual references to
          the reliability claims, the rarity of articulations of complex
          evaluations of search results, and the idea of 'searching' (both in
          terms of using a search engine and engaging oneself in the activity of
          searching) as a sufficient precondition of a successful retrieval of
          authoritative results give an impression that searchers have a
          tendency to conceptualise searching in terms of factual retrieval.</p>
          
        <p>At the same time, however, the general diversity of articulations
          suggests a high degree of situational contextuality of the
          authorities. In this sense, the paralleling of Web searching and
          factual retrieval is an equally contextual matter. Simplistic
          evaluation criteria and reliance on ad hoc articulations are
          problematic only if they are unreliable in practice. Instead of being
          an indication of a low level of information literacy (e.g., <a href="paper567.html#Alexandersson2005">Alexandersson
            and Limberg 2005</a>), a specific assumption of the possibility of
          factual retrieval can also be an indication of a knowledge of the
          contextual adequacy and reliability of particular cognitive
          authorities. Similar to Hargittai et al.'s (<a href="paper567.html#Hargittai2010">2010</a>)
          study, many utterances contain references to search context, brands
          (e.g., Google and Bing), routines (searching as a routine), and the
          social contexts of particular discussion forums or blogs, or the
          <em>community</em> of Internet users as a whole. Paraphrasing Addelson (<a href="paper567.html#Addelson2003">2003</a>),
          the cognitive authorities articulated by searchers are exercised
          rather than static entities. By their utterances, the searchers do not
          only refer to existing authorities. The utterances themselves put
          cognitive authority on searching and contribute to the evolution of
          general assumptions of the reliability and usefulness of the activity.
          In spite of their exercised nature, the categories of authority
          identified in the material meet the two premisory criteria of
          cognitive authority. The utterances contain references to various
          forms of  <em>expertise</em> (both as expertise and as a broader
          dependability) and reputation (<a href="paper567.html#wilson1983">Wilson 1983</a>),
          of which the existence of the utterances themselves is an illustrative
          albeit not the sole example.</p>
          
        <p>In comparison to classical types of cognitive authorities such as
          institutions or individuals, most of the articulated authorities in
          the material (apart from the relatively few examples of named
          individuals or sources e.g., N234) reside on a higher level of
          abstraction and are reminiscent of the contextual rather than static
          relevance criteria (e.g., <a href="paper567.html#Savolainen2006a">Savolainen and
            Kari 2006</a>), types of credibility assessments (e.g., <a href="paper567.html#Wathen2002">Wathen
            and Burkell 2002</a>) and characteristics of cognitive authorities
          (e.g., <a href="paper567.html#Taraborelli2008">Taraborelli 2008</a>; <a href="paper567.html#Addelson2003">Addelson
            2003</a>) discussed in the earlier literature. In contrast to the
          observations of Savolainen (<a href="paper567.html#Savolainen2007b">2007</a>), the
          analysed utterances give an impression that the authoritativeness of
          search engines and the Internet is not merely a question of the
          perceived credibility of the media. The media and its use produces
          cognitive authorities in the utterances that make assumptions of the
          existence or veracity of claims on the basis of their findability on
          in the Internet and/or using the major search engines. The present
          observations do, however, correspond to those of Savolainen in the
          sense that the cognitive authorities identified in the present study
          are abstract and situated. It is doubtful whether they would be
          acknowledged as authorities (in a traditional sense) if the question
          of their authoritativeness were discussed in an interview as
          Savolainen did in his study. As with Savolainen's informants, even if
          a large majority of the analysed utterances show that searchers rely
          on the authoritativeness of Web searching, it is highly doubtful
          whether the authors of the analysed utterances would explicitly
          acknowledge searching as an absolute authority per se.</p>
        <p>Besides being indicative of the presence of certain typical cognitive
          authorities, the utterances provide direct evidence of the ways in
          which cognitive authorities are articulated in everyday life contexts
          and how the articulations influence the seeking, creation and sharing
          of information on the Internet. A common utterance that a searcher was
          unable to find an answer or a solution followed by the missing piece
          of information (e.g., W12, I177) shows how the assumed
          authoritativeness of a search may function as (obviously) a partial
          incentive to create and share new information if it seems that no
          earlier information is available. In some cases, the searchers made a
          direct reference to an absolute inference of the veracity of a
          statement on the basis of a successful or an unsuccessful search. Good
          and bad reviews but also the lack of reputation seemed to be enough to
          cast doubts on the plausibility of a particular claim (e.g., W84) and
          to provide incentives for making further inquiries. The presupposed
          authoritativeness of search engines as a reliable and easy to use
          source of information, functions also as a justification to ask for
          help in case of a failed search (e.g., G12, A11). If, and as it seems
          in many contexts only if, a search fails, it is socially acceptable to
          post a direct question. It seems that the assumption of the necessity
          to search has become a '<em>ritual of verification</em>' (<a href="paper567.html#Moss2011">Moss
            2011</a>). We are supposed to perform a ritualistic search before
          doing anything else even if the actual search were an entirely nominal
          effort without any practical relevance.</p>
          
        <p>There are some evident limitations in the study. The material is
          collected from the Web and is likely to represent only a fraction of
          all possible expressions related to the searching for information.
          Since the analysed utterances focus on explicit acts of searching, it
          is apparent that the data is less useful for analysing the impact of
          such general aspects of the cognitive authority of Web searching as,
          for instance, the impact of privacy concerns, the 'filter bubble' or
          commercialist aspirations of search companies. This limitation relates
          to the premises of the data collection method, which is based on
          hypothetical assumptions of the potential relevance of particular
          utterances in explaining certain phenomena. The analysed material <em>per
          se</em> represents an unknown sample of English-speaking users of
          particular types of mostly conversational Web services, but as such
          the utterances are articulations and as such significant expressions
          of the assumptions of credibility. At the same time, however, it is
          reasonable to expect that the individual articulations express only
          some of the complexity of the underlying processes making inferences
          about the credibility of information. It is also reasonable to believe
          that some of the utterances can be more plausibly explained by other
          factors than as references to authority and credibility. Finally, the
          anecdotal nature of the evidence makes it impossible to analyse
          complete search processes (as in e.g., <a href="paper567.html#Rieh2002">Rieh 2002</a>)
          and to make advanced inferences of their contexts. In spite of its
          limitations, the data and data collection method has advantages. The
          material is likely to represent more naturalistic and contextually
          realistic utterances than an interview or a survey study could
          produce. When searchers are not explicitly asked to reflect on their
          cognitive authorities it is possible to observe how the ideas of
          authority function in everyday life contexts and what their impact and
          practical relevance in information seeking and socialising in the
          Internet are.</p>
          
        <p>The findings have twofold implications for systems design. Besides
          the quality and relevance of retrieved information (and measurement of
          search effort), the perceived authoritativeness of the search exercise
          could be a significant indicator of the level of success of a query.
          If a searcher sees that the cognitive authority of a particular search
          is low, the results may be seen as less reliable and vice versa.
          Search systems might be designed to provide information on the
          potential authority of the search from the systems point of view. Also
          the fact that searchers seem to be at least rather well aware of why
          their searches might fail may suggest that this information might be
          used to increase the success of searching by providing help on the
          aspects of search that were perceived to fail. In this sense cognitive
          authority information could function as an additional form of
          relevance feedback. To operationalise the findings, an important topic
          of future studies is whether it is possible to automatically identify
          patterns of search behaviour that are directly attributable to
          perceived cognitive authority of searches and how to operationalise
          such data. </p>
