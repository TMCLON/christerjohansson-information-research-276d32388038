<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Vocabulary control has been revealed as an essential procedure in the organization and retrieval of information. The most significant contributions in this field of work are many and varied although the main ones taken here are those from Gil-Leiva, <a href="paper502.html#Gil2008">2008</a>: 118-154. The first contribution was the work done by Charles Ammi Cutter in his famous <em>Rules for a printed dictionary catalog</em> published in 1876. It is here that the first rules appear that are in effect today, such as the principle of economy, the definition and use of the term headings for both matter and for place and form; re-sending for synonyms and antonyms; the problem of homonymy; the structure of the subject headings (simple and complex); word inversion; syntax (See, See also, etc.) and punctuation marks (commas, brackets, etc.).</p>

<p>The second contribution was the building of lists of subject headings. Shortly after the contributions of Cutter, the American Library Association (ALA) published in 1895 the <em>List of Subject Headings for Use in Dictionary Catalogs</em> as an indexing tool for small and medium sized libraries with non specialized stocks. The first <em>Subject Headings Used in the Dictionary Catalogs of the Library of Congress</em> appeared in 1909 and took as its main references the contributions mentioned above. Although it came into being for internal use for the cataloguers in the Library of Congress, it would soon become a reference tool used in indexing in large public and academic libraries and it was translated or either totally or partially adapted to other countries and languages, for example, Brazil (1948), Canada (1967), Greece (1978), South Africa (1992) or Egypt (1995) among others.</p>

<p>The third contribution comes from Mooers, who at the beginning of the 1950s introduced the word <em>descriptor</em> to communicate ideas, so distancing himself from particular terminological uses employed in documents and thus specifying the subject of the information in an information retrieval context. A follow-on to this was the construction of the first lists of descriptors and the first thesauri, like the Dupont Thesaurus (Engineering Information Centre Du Dupont 1959), the Thesaurus of Astia Descriptors (United States Department of Defense, 1960), or the Chemical Engineering Thesaurus (American Institute of Chemical Engineers, 1961), among others.</p>

<p>The fourth contribution is the provision of national and international norms. Work in this sphere got underway early in France, since in 1957 the AFNOR Z 44-070 <em>Catalogue alphab&eacute;tique de mati&egrave;res</em> was presented, which was devoted to establishing and providing rules for the choice and presentation of subject headings. The first norms for thesauri were the French AFNOR Z 47-100-1973 (Norme experimental. Regles d&#8217;&eacute;tablissement des th&egrave;saurus monolingues), the ISO 2788-1974 (Documentation. Guides for the establishment and development of monolingual thesauri) and the ANSI Z39.19-1974 (American National Standard guidelines for thesaurus structure, construction and use). Since then, other countries and the ISO itself have been working on and extending the norms until the unification of the ISO 2788-1986 and ISO 5964-1985 in the new ISO/DIS 25964-1:2010 (Information and documentation&mdash;Thesauri and interoperability with other vocabularies (Part 1: Thesauri for information retrieval; Part 2: Interoperability with other vocabularies).</p>

<p>The evaluation of controlled vocabularies is an issue of concern for professionals and researchers in the area. The evaluation can be performed with the aim of the analysis being the controlled vocabularies themselves so as to study their structure, the thematic fields or facets, scope notes, semantic relations, degree of specificity, etc., (intrinsic evaluation) or by studying the impact on the information systems which use them both in indexing and retrieval (extrinsic evaluation).</p>

<p>The first evaluation of import was carried out by Cleverdon in the Cranfield Projects  (<a href="paper502.html#Cleverdon1956">1956</a>;  <a href="paper502.html#Cleverdon1960">1960</a>, etc.). Cleverdon compared the efficiency of the Universal Decimal Classification, an alphabetical index of subjects, a faceted classification scheme and the indexing through uniterms of eighteen thousand documents analysed by three indexers. There have been many and varied subsequent studies to evaluate controlled vocabularies, both subject headings and thesauri. We have for example the works by Henzler (<a href="paper502.html#Henzler">1978</a>), Fidel (<a href="paper502.html#Fidel1991">1991</a> and <a href="paper502.html#Fidel1992">1992</a>), Betts and Marrable (<a href="paper502.html#Betts">1991</a>); Ribeiro (<a href="paper502.html#Ribeiro">1996</a>), Gil Urdicia&iacute;n (<a href="paper502.html#Urdiciain1998">1998</a>) and Gross and Taylor (<a href="paper502.html#Gross">2005</a>), who studied the advantages and drawbacks of indexing and retrieving documents in natural language and in controlled language.</p>

<p>Another way of evaluating controlled vocabularies, mainly thesauri, is to compare them with each other. Kishida, <em>et al.</em> (<a href="paper502.html#Kishida">1988</a>) compared the MeSH (Medical Subject Headings), the ERIC thesaurus, the INSPEC and the Root thesaurus, among others, taking as their reference the construction principles, their structure and the information they contributed. In contrast, Weinberg and Cunningham (<a href="paper502.html#Weinberg">1985</a>) studied the semantic proximity between MeSH and Medline, while Pozhariskii (<a href="paper502.html#Pozhariskii">1982</a>) proposed quantifying the capacity or semantic strength of a thesaurus in terms of flexibility, economy and universality. Elsewhere, Larsen (<a href="paper502.html#Larsen">1988</a>) analysed the capacities for use of a thesaurus for indexing a certain collection of documents. Soler Monreal (<a href="paper502.html#Soler">2009</a>) evaluated three controlled vocabularies (a list of descriptors, a standard thesaurus and an augmented thesaurus in which all the descriptors have scope notes) in order to find out if consistency scores higher than a standard thesaurus and augmented thesaurus are obtained with a list of descriptors.</p>

<p>Indexing consistency can be studied as a reference to a single indexer or to several. When a professional indexes the same document at different moments in time we speak of intra-consistency or intra-indexer consistency. And when several people indexing a document to compare the results or the result of indexing a document by two indexers is compared, we speak of inter-consistency or inter-indexer consistency.</p>

<p>Since the 1960s, numerous and diverse investigations have been carried out on indexing consistency. The main conclusion which can be drawn from the tests is that inconsistency is an inherent feature of indexing, rather than a sporadic anomaly. Although the tests carried out are very diverse in their methodology, we can say that achieved indexing consistency ranges from approximately 10% to 60%. The vast majority of the tests carried out from 1960 until the present time cannot be homogenized because of the methodological diversity used. We only point out here some of the variables that hinder their homogenization and only a sample of the tests carried out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Measures: To find the consistency scores between groups of indexers Slamecka &amp; Jacoby (<a href="paper502.html#Slamecka">1965</a>) and Iivonen (<a href="paper502.html#Iivonen1990">1990</a>) proposed their respective measures. In contrast, for pairs of indexers, other measures were outlined as in Hooper (<a href="paper502.html#Hooper">1965</a>), Lancaster (<a href="paper502.html#lancaster1968">1968</a>), Rolling (<a href="paper502.html#Rolling">1981</a>) or Saarti (<a href="paper502.html#Saarti">2002</a>), although the most commonly used in most tests is that of Hooper, c / (a + b - c), where c is the common terms between the two indexers, a is the terms proposed by indexer one, and b is the terms proposed by indexer two.</li>

  <li>Novice versus expert indexers: On some occasions expert indexers were employed as in Lancaster (<a href="paper502.html#lancaster1968">1968</a>), Leonard (<a href="paper502.html#Leonard1975">1975</a>); on others it was with novice indexers Hudon (<a href="paper502.html#Hudon1998">1998a</a> and <a href="paper502.html#Hudon1998congreso">1998b</a>), Gil-Leiva (<a href="paper502.html#Gil2002">2002</a>); or with experts and novices (Bertrand and Cellier <a href="paper502.html#Bertrand">1995</a>; Saarti, <a href="paper502.html#Saarti">2002</a>; Soler Monreal <a href="paper502.html#Soler">2009</a>).</li>

  <li>Number of indexers: Lancaster (<a href="paper502.html#lancaster1968">1968</a>) worked with three indexers;
Bertrand and Cellier (<a href="paper502.html#Bertrand">1995</a>) twenty-five indexers; Hudon (<a href="paper502.html#Hudon1998">1998a</a> and <a href="paper502.html#Hudon1998congreso">1998b</a>) twenty-five indexers; Gil-Leiva (<a href="paper502.html#Gil2002">2002</a>) twenty-seven indexers; Saarti (<a href="paper502.html#Saarti">2002</a>) thirty indexers; and Soler Monreal (<a href="paper502.html#Soler">2009</a>) sixty-three indexers.</li>

  <li>Material used: Sometimes work has been with journal articles (<a href="paper502.html#lancaster1968">Lancaster 1968</a>; <a href="paper502.html#Leonard1977">Leonard 1977</a>; <a href="paper502.html#Funk">Funk and Reid  1983</a>; <a href="paper502.html#Middleton">Middleton 1984</a>; <a href="paper502.html#Sievert">Sievert and Andrews 1991</a>; <a href="paper502.html#Iivonen1998">Iivonen and Kivim&auml;ki 1998</a>; <a href="paper502.html#Leininger">Leininger 2000</a>; <a href="paper502.html#Gil2002">Gil-Leiva 2002</a>), sometimes with books (<a href="paper502.html#Tonta">Tonta 1991</a>; <a href="paper502.html#Bertrand">Bertrand and Cellier 1995</a>; <a href="paper502.html#Gil2001">Gil-Leiva 2001</a>; <a href="paper502.html#Saarti">Saarti 2002</a>; <a href="paper502.html#Neshat">Neshat and Horri 2006</a>; <a href="paper502.html#GilyPolsinelli">Gil-Leiva <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>; <a href="paper502.html#Chen2008">Chen 2008</a>) and at other times with visual material (<a href="paper502.html#Markey">Markey 1984</a> and <a href="paper502.html#Gil2002">Gil-Leiva 2002</a>); summaries of journal articles have also been used (<a href="paper502.html#Hudon1998">Hudon 1998</a>; <a href="paper502.html#Soler">Soler Monreal 2009</a>); social tagging on delicious.com <a href="paper502.html#Kipp">Kipp 2009</a>) and social tagging on CiteULike.org (<a href="paper502.html#Wolfram">Wolfram <em>et al.</em> 2009</a>).</li>

  <li>Number of documents indexed: Lancaster (<a href="paper502.html#lancaster1968">1968</a>) used sixteen articles; Tarr and Borko (<a href="paper502.html#Tarr">1974</a>) fifteen items; Leonard (<a href="paper502.html#Leonard1975">1975</a>) 100 articles; Funk and Reid (<a href="paper502.html#Funk">1983</a>) 760 articles; Markey (<a href="paper502.html#Markey">1984</a>) 100 documents; Iivonen (<a href="paper502.html#Iivonen1990">1990</a>) ten documents; Siever and Andrews (<a href="paper502.html#Sievert">1991</a>) seventy-one articles; Iivonen and Kivim&auml;ki (<a href="paper502.html#IivonenKivimaki">1998</a>) forty-nine documents; Leninger (<a href="paper502.html#Leininger">2000</a>) sixty documents; Tonta (<a href="paper502.html#Tonta">1991</a>) eighty-two books; Bertrand and Cellier (<a href="paper502.html#Bertrand">1995</a>) eight books; Gil-Leiva (<a href="paper502.html#Gil2001">2001</a>) eleven books; Saarti (<a href="paper502.html#Saarti">2002</a>) five books; Gil-Leiva <em>et al.</em> (<a href="paper502.html#GilyPolsinelli">2008</a>) ten books; Chen (<a href="paper502.html#Chen2008">2008</a>) 3,307 monographs; Hudon (<a href="paper502.html#Hudon1998">1998a</a> and <a href="paper502.html#Hudon1998congreso">1998b</a>) twelve abstracts; Monreal Soler (<a href="paper502.html#Soler">2009</a>) three abstracts.</li>

  <li>Hawthorne effect: Individuals, when they know that they are being studied behave differently from when they do not know they are being observed. In some studies indexers knew their product would be evaluated (<a href="paper502.html#lancaster1968">Lancaster 1968</a>; <a href="paper502.html#Leonard1975">Leonard 1975</a>; <a href="paper502.html#Bertrand">Bertrand and Cellier 1995</a>; Hudon (<a href="paper502.html#Hudon1998">1998a</a> and <a href="paper502.html#Hudon1998congreso">1998b</a>); <a href="paper502.html#Gil2002">Gil-Leiva 2002</a>; <a href="paper502.html#Saarti">Saarti, 2002</a>; <a href="paper502.html#Soler">Soler Monreal 2009</a>); and in other studies as the result of indexing the same documents is compared but in different information systems could not be this possibility as, for example, two bibliographic databases: Middleton (<a href="paper502.html#Middleton">1984</a>) compares the indexing of ERIS/APAIS and AEI/APAIS; Iivonen and Kivim&auml;ki (<a href="paper502.html#IivonenKivimaki">1998</a>) databases KINF and LISA; or compare the indexing library catalogues like Tonta (<a href="paper502.html#Tonta">1991</a>) who compared the Library of Congress and the British Library; Gil-Leiva (<a href="paper502.html#Gil2001">2001</a>) in thirty-one catalogues of public libraries; Neshat and Horri (<a href="paper502.html#Neshat">2006</a>) National Library of Iran and twelve academic libraries; Gil-Leiva <em>et al.</em> (<a href="paper502.html#GilyPolsinelli">2008</a>) thirty university library catalogues; Chen (<a href="paper502.html#Chen2008">2008</a>), the National Library of China and the China Academy Library &amp; Information System. Finally, duplicate records in information systems, Funk and Reid (<a href="paper502.html#Funk">1983</a>) use 760 articles indexed in Medline twice; Siever and Andrews (<a href="paper502.html#Sievert">1991</a>) worked with seventy-one duplicates of the database Information Science Abstracts; Leininger (<a href="paper502.html#Leininger">2000</a>) compared sixty duplicates of the PsycINFO database.</li>

  <li>Concepts versus terms: In most of the studies mentioned above these are compared with all the indexing terms or descriptors derived from a controlled vocabulary, while sometimes comparisons were made with the concepts taken directly from the documents to find consistency, such as Iivonen (<a href="paper502.html#Iivonen1990">1990</a>) or Gil-Leiva (<a href="paper502.html#Gil2002">2002</a>), that take both the concepts used as descriptors from Eurovoc Thesaurus.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials and methods</h2>

<p>For this study we built three controlled vocabularies on information science: a list of descriptors with control for synonymy; a standard thesaurus and a thesaurus in which all the descriptors have scope notes (augmented thesaurus).</p>

<p>At the time of initiating this research there did not exist in Spanish a thesaurus published on this subject. Hence, we began to refine a list of descriptors consisting of 2,756 terms which were in use in the design and maintenance of an automatic indexing system (<a href="paper502.html#Gil1997">Gil-Leiva 1997</a> and <a href="paper502.html#Gil2008">2008</a>). Finally, the list was a total of 2,455 terms, of which 1,436 are descriptors and 1,019 non-descriptors. A standard thesaurus was constructed from this list. This thesaurus has an alphabetic display, another hierarchical one and other types KWOC permuted index. <a href="paper502.html#appa">Appendix A</a> shows the first terms of the three tools built.</p>

<p>The thesauri were built with the thesaurus management software <em><a href="http://www.multites.com/" target="_blank">MultiTes</a></em> and following Spanish norm UNE 50-106-90 (equivalent to ISO 2788-1986).</p>

<p>Finally, specialized dictionaries are used to add the scope notes to all the descriptors to build augmented thesaurus.</p>

<p>After building the three controlled vocabularies, an intrinsic
(qualitative and quantitative) evaluation was carried out to check that
they comply with the recommendations for the compilation of thesauri.
The compilation was carried out following the parameters proposed by
Lancaster (<a href="paper502.html#Lancaster2002">2002</a>), Gil Urdicia&iacute;n (<a href="paper502.html#Urdiciain2004">2004</a>) and Gil-Leiva (<a href="paper502.html#Gil2008">2008</a>).
It was
confirmed that the thesauri meet the traditional requisites for
compilation of thesauri.<br />
</p>

<p>Later, we decided that the material to be indexed was to be
three
abstracts of journal articles since these are concise, well structured
and understandable information sources (<a href="paper502.html#appb">Appendix B</a>). We then worked on
the
selection of the indexers who were going to use the three indexing
languages to index three abstracts of information science articles.
Finally, we decided that the indexers should have different levels of
experience.</p>

<p>Group 1: Second year information science students<br />
Group 2: Fourth year information science students<br />
Group 3: Fifth year information science students<br />
Group 4: Experienced professionals in document indexing</p>

<p>The three groups of students already had some theoretical and
practical knowledge of indexing and use of controlled vocabularies.
Each group
comprised eighteen people and was divided into three subgroups of six
indexers for each of the three tools. The exception was Group 4, which
was made up of nine professionals for whom indexing is a habitual task.
The professionals work in documentation centres in public
administration (3), communication (3) and technological institutes (3).
These were also subdivided into nuclei of three indexers per tool. None
of the indexers were familiar with the indexing languages constructed
for the tests, although both the novice and the expert indexers had
used indexing languages from other fields. Finally, it should be
mentioned that it was difficult to find more professionals who were
available to participate in these types of tests.</p>

<p>The results of the indexing of the three abstracts were compared
pair wise, so novice indexers were compared fifteen times for each of
the
three articles and for each of the three tools being compared &#8211; giving
a total of 137 comparisons. As regards the expert indexers, three
comparisons were obtained for each for each of the three articles and
the three tools under comparison &#8211; giving a total of twenty-seven comparisons.</p>

<p>We used a relaxed, and non exact, system of coincidence to
calculate
consistency between indexers, as was done in Gil-Leiva (<a href="paper502.html#Gil2001">2001</a>) and Gil-
Leiva <em>et al.</em> (<a href="paper502.html#GilyPolsinelli">2008</a>).
A coincidence of
1 (100%), 0.5 (50%) or 0 (0%) was considered. For example, if one
indexer consigns librarians and another reference librarians, a
consistency of 0.5 is recorded. As a general norm, it was considered
that a score of 0.5 should be awarded to those non coincident terms
that were, however, specific of another one, while 1 was given to very
similar concepts.</p>

<p>Since their beginnings, tests on indexing consistency have used
various formulas, among which the most important are those used by
Hooper
(<a href="paper502.html#Hooper">1965</a>) and Rolling (<a href="paper502.html#Rolling">1981</a>).
Gil-Leiva (<a href="paper502.html#Gil1997">1997</a> and <a href="paper502.html#Gil2001">2001</a>),
Gil-Leiva <em>et al.</em> (<a href="paper502.html#GilyPolsinelli">2008</a>) and
Soler Monreal
(<a href="paper502.html#Soler">2009</a>). We have used extensively Hooper&#8217;s measure
of indexing
consistency adapted as follows:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">C<sub><em>i</em></sub> = <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>T</em><sub><em>co</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</sub></u><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<em>A + B) - T<sub>co</sub></em></p>

<p>where C<em><sub>i</sub></em> is the consistency between two indexings, T<em><sub>co</sub></em> is
the
number
of terms in common between the two indexings, A is the number of terms
used by Indexer A, B is the number of terms used by Indexer B, and T<em><sub>co</sub></em>
is the number of terms they use in common.</p>

<p>For group 1 (Second year students) the standard thesaurus and
the
list of descriptors return the same levels (29.6% and 29.5%), followed
by
the augmented thesaurus (25.9%).

<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 1: Group 1 - Second year students</strong></div>

<p>In group 2 (Fourth year students) the list of descriptors
returned
the best consistency results, 39.8%, versus 34.1% for the augmented
thesaurus and 23.7% for the standard thesaurus, as shown in 
Figure 2 below:

<p>For group 3 (Fifth year students) the augmented thesaurus
returns
the best results (35.8%), followed closely by the list of descriptors
(33.3%), as shown in Figure 3.</p>

</div>
<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 3: Group 3 - Fifth year students</strong></div>


<p>From the results it can be stated that the list of descriptors
provides the highest indexing consistency among all novice indexers,
with 34.2%
coincidence, versus 31.9% for the augmented thesaurus and 29. 2 % for
the standard thesaurus, as Figure 4 shows.</p>

<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 4: All novice indexers</strong></div>


<p>Expert indexers (Group 4) also obtain their maximum consistency
index with the list of descriptors, 55.7%. In second place are the
results
obtained with the standard thesaurus, 31.3%. The lowest consistency,
23.7%, was returned with the augmented thesaurus. This may be due to a
lack of previous knowledge of this tool or to the fact that the scope
notes annotate the meaning of the terms, leading the indexer to choose
certain descriptors on the basis of the definition given and not
according to previously conceived ideas.</p>

<p>We have also found the mean for all the consistency obtained for
both expert and novice indexers. It is clearly observed that the tool
with
the best results is the list of descriptors (39.5% consistency),
followed by the augmented thesaurus (29.8%) and, with a similar value,
the standard thesaurus (27.7%), as can be seen in Figure 6.</p>

<p>With the exception of two cases, the highest consistency occurs for abstract Number Two.</p>

<p>The results obtained in this study fall within the margins of
consistency obtained in other previous studies, ranging from
approximately 10% to 60% (Lancaster <a href="paper502.html#lancaster1968">1968</a>;

Gil-Leiva <em>et al.</em> <a href="paper502.html#GilyPolsinelli">2008</a> and Kipp <a href="paper502.html#Kipp">2009</a>). We also said in the
introduction to this article that we can compare our results with the
data achieved by Hudon (<a href="paper502.html#Hudon1998">1998a</a> and <a href="paper502.html#Hudon1998congreso">1998b</a>). Hudon also used three
versions of a thesaurus - a) standard thesaurus, b) standard thesaurus
with definitions for all their descriptors and c) stripped thesaurus
with definitions, but hierarchical and associative relationships
between terms, to see if the definitions including all descriptors of
a thesaurus can raise levels of consistency among novice indexers.</p>

<p>Hudon's results show that a) for the selection of all
descriptors
(main and minor), indexers who worked with the augmented thesaurus did
not
obtain better consistency than those who worked with the standard
thesaurus; b) indexers that used the stripped thesaurus were equally or
more consistent with each other than those who used the standard
thesaurus. In contrast, for the selection of main descriptor indexers
who worked with the augmented thesaurus consistency scores were better
than the standard thesaurus in seven of the twelve documents, and the stripped
thesaurus indexers were more consistent than the standard thesaurus
indexers in eight of the twelve documents. Hudon concludes that the
availability of definitions in a thesaurus does not increase the
consistency in indexing of novice indexers in the selection of main and
minor descriptors, and the availability of definitions in a thesaurus
may lead to novice indexers achieving acceptable levels of consistency
in the selection of the main descriptor when using a stripped thesaurus.</p>

<p>In our research it has become clear that the list of descriptors
achieved the highest levels of consistency in indexing for both novice
and expert indexers. However, in the results obtained by Hudon with a
stripped thesaurus with respect to others (standard thesaurus and
standard thesaurus with definitions) there are some indications to
suggest that the lists of descriptors can achieve similar results to
standard thesauri and augmented thesauri.</p>

<p>In any case, further research is required to corroborate these
results. One important limitation of this research that should be
pointed out is
that in the two comparative studies we do not know what percentage of
inconsistency is due to the complexity and subjectivity of indexing
(reading and analysis of the document and selection of the appropriate
keywords) or to the later selection of the descriptors of the
controlled vocabulary (conversion of the selected keywords to
descriptors of the controlled vocabulary); or how much inconsistency is
due to the indexing languages used.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Inconsistency is an inherent feature of indexing, as we have
seen
from
the data obtained in research conducted since the 1960s to the present
day. Precisely because of the disparity of variables used in the
research, it may be appropriate to carry out a systematic review and or
meta-analysis of the relevant literature on indexing consistency to
provide more light on this issue. Similarly, as has already been
suggested, more research is needed on the properties of the lists of
descriptors compared to standard thesauri or augmented thesauri with
application notes or notes of definition, because in a small
information system is always easier to build a list of descriptors than
a thesaurus. Further examination of the properties of the lists of
descriptors compared to thesauri could be a line of study to follow but
with the inclusion of techniques using verbal protocols or &#8216;thinking
aloud&#8217; during the process of indexing the documents with thesauri. This
technique will allow valuable information to be gathered on the use
that indexers make of associative and hierarchical relations.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract 1</strong></p>

<p>ARAUJO RU&iacute;Z, J.A., ARENCIBIA JORGE, R. y GUTIRREZ CALZADO, C.
Ensayos cl&iacute;nicos cubanos publicados en revistas de impacto
internacional: estudio bibliomtrico del per&iacute;odo 1991-2001. <em>Revista
Espaola de Documentaci&oacute;n Cient&iacute;fica</em>,
2002, vol. 25, n 3, p. 254-266.</p>

<p>The aim of this work is to assess the scope of the clinical research
performed by Cuban scientific institutions. A
retrospective search about clinical trials published by journals
indexed in <em>MEDLINE
</em>and <em>Science Citation Index </em>was carried out, and 172
references to
works published with the participation of Cuban research centers were
retrieved. A group of 653 Cuban and 175 foreign authors were
identified. The average of authors by article was 7.16, and the most
common author
groups were made up of more than six specialists. A total of 82
clinical trials
were the result of collaborations between scientific institutions; 83
research centers
took part in the trials, 36 of them from others countries. The reports
about the 172 clinical trials were published in 96 journals from 17
countries, and the 74,4 % of the articles were written in English.
Sixty-three therapeutic products,
techniques and procedures were tested in different types of
patients,and 41 disorders were treated. Human adults, with a relative
balance between
women and men, were the subjects most frequently studied. The
bibliometric study
made it possible to confirm the Cuban advances as regards to the
clinical
trials execution for the authentication of products reached by the
medical-pharmaceutical industry, as well as to define the research
centers in the vanguard regarding this subject.</p>

CARO CASTRO, C., CEDEIRA SERANTES, L. y TRAVIESO RODR&iacute;GUEZ, C. La
investigaci&oacute;n sobre recuperaci&oacute;n de informaci&oacute;n
desde la perspectiva centrada en el usuario: mtodos y variables. <em>Revista

<p><br />
User has been included in the research in
information retrieval, and this factor has implied a new research
approach.
This perspective is focused on new issues related to searching process,
such as
formulation of queries, interaction between user and system, evaluation
of the
results obtained and influence of some personal characteristics. This
exploratory paper examines 25 original research works of the
user-centered
perspective. A classification of the variables according to the
following
categories has been established: user characteristics, searching
environment
and process, and results. The coincidence in data collecting
techniques,
analysis methods and variables has served for checking the similarity
between
the research works analysed. Finally, a graphical representation of the
different trends observed in these works is presented.</p>

of data bases, and to apply the existing models to a real case: the
ISOC data
base. To this end, two questionnaires have been designed: one addressed
to end
users and the other to reference librarians. The results show the
differences
between the two groups in the use, reasons for consultation, objectives
and
satisfaction. A difference in objectives and level of satisfaction has
also
been found between the two main users: researchers and professors on
the one
hand, and students, on the other. The results allow us to establish a
map of the
use of ISOC data base and to obtain some value indicators. It is
concluded that
ISOC is widely used and generally well valued. These kinds of studies
have
proved to be necessary in order to follow up users&#8217; requirements.</p>
