 <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The lack of research, theoretical understanding and methodological development in studies on information use is often noted in library and information science 
(see e.g. <a href="paper535.html#kar07">Kari 2007</a>; <a href="paper535.html#sav09a">Savolainen 2009a</a> and <a href="paper535.html#sav09b">b</a>; <a href="paper535.html#vak97">Vakkari 1997</a>; 
 <a href="paper535.html#vak08">2008</a>). One of the challenges of use studies is the concept of <em>use</em> and its definition (<a href="paper535.html#kar07">Kari 2007</a>, <a href="paper535.html#kar10">2010</a>; <a href="paper535.html#sav09a">Savolainen 2009a</a>). Closely following are the methodological challenges of operationalising this concept.</p>

<p>The goal of our study was to enhance the tools available for the study of information  use and knowledge construction by developing a method for the analysis of text  transformations from sources to written texts. This type of text analysis has previously been used in reading-to-write studies (see <a href="paper535.html#spi97">Spivey 1997</a>; <a href="paper535.html#wil99">Wiley and Voss 1999</a>) but not in information studies. We prepared our approach in a pilot study the findings of which are reported elsewhere (<a href="paper535.html#sor11">Sormunen and Lehtiö 2011</a>). In this paper we introduce an extended and revised method and the findings of a larger case study where the method was applied. </p>

<p>We argue that source-based writing is one of the most typical modes of information  use and that it is crucial to understand how information derived from sources  is processed in composing new texts. For example, in information literacy instruction  it is not enough to warn students against copy-pasting. Rather we should illustrate  in concrete terms how valid arguments are built in the creative scrutiny of  sources and in the synthesis of information. Students also need to understand  the contextual requirements of the task, such as the genre in which they write. </p>

<p> The paper is organized as follows: First, a short review on related research  is given. Second, we introduce the proposed method by describing the domain  (application area) for which it is designed, the procedure for using it and  a coding scheme used in demonstrating the method. Then a case study exemplifying  the method as a researcher’s tool is reported. On the basis of the case study,  we present justifications for the method by discussing its appropriateness,  validity, reliability and efficiency.</p>

<h2>Related research</h2>

<p>In the literature review, we first look at information use in the context of  learning. We then visit common definitions and research methods applied in studies  of information use. Thirdly, experimental research done in reading-to-write  studies is introduced. Finally, we present the summary of our pilot study</p>

<h3>Studies on information use in a learning context</h3>

<p>Previous research suggests a link between student motivation, depth of knowledge  construction, and information use in classroom assignments. The analysis of  written texts as expressions of topical understanding sheds light on both information  use and knowledge construction as a process. Descriptive texts have been found  to imply a more superficial knowledge construction process, while more analytical  texts often reveal more sophisticated in-depth learning (<a href="paper535.html#tod06">Todd  2006</a>).</p>
<p>Limberg (<a href="paper535.html#lim99">1999</a>) observed that poorly performing students  had a tendency to <em>fact finding</em> approaches which easily led to copy-pasting  in independent learning tasks. These students are not interested in genuine  inquiry but rather in collecting <em>right answers</em> from sources and transferring  them to a research paper (<a href="paper535.html#ale03">Alexandersson and Limberg 2003</a>).  Similarly students with a surface approach to studying tend to gather information  merely for task completion as opposed to striving for genuine learning (<a href="paper535.html#hei02">Heinstr&ouml;m  2003</a>; <a href="paper535.html#hei06">2006</a>). McGregor and Streitenberger (<a href="paper535.html#mcg04">2004</a>)  observed that the levels of copying and plagiarism were higher among students  who concentrated on the format of the end product (<em>looking good</em>) than on the  process of gathering and synthesising information for its content.</p>

 <p>In the internet age, it is an obvious risk that students transfer information mechanically from  sources to their own texts instead of transforming it in the cognitive process  of knowledge construction. The least engaged students thereby fail to achieve  learning goals in topical contents as well as in information literacies. Surprisingly,  copy-pasting has rarely been studied by comparing sources used and texts written,  except in the context of plagiarism (see <a href="paper535.html#mcg04">McGregor and Streitenberger  2004</a>; <a href="paper535.html#mcg05">McGregor and Williamson 2005</a>).</p>
 
<h3> The concept of information use and methods for studying it </h3>

<p>So far, the information science community has not agreed upon the definition of information  use. Different conceptions of the term include interpreting <em>information  use</em> as: information practice, information search, information processing,  knowledge construction, information production, applying information and effects  of information (<a href="paper535.html#kar10">Kari 2010</a>). Information use is also interpreted  in diverse ways by users themselves (<a href="paper535.html#kir02">Kirk 2002</a>; <a href="paper535.html#may06">Maybee  2006</a>).</p>

<p>Kari (<a href="paper535.html#kar07">2007</a>) suggests that the term information <em>outcome</em>  might be a more appropriate term, as it includes both information use (what  a person does with information) and information effect (the influence of information  on a person). Most studies on information use within information science have focused on what  Kari (<a href="paper535.html#kar07">2007</a>) calls information effect. One example is the  cognitive constructivism approach, which focuses on the process of knowledge  construction (<a href="paper535.html#sav09a">Savolainen 2009a</a>). An alternative viewpoint  is to regard information use as '<em>a process that is contextualized in action  or practice</em>' (<a href="paper535.html#sav09a">Savolainen 2009a</a>). This notion emphasizes  what people do with information rather than what information does to people  (<a href="paper535.html#kar07">Kari 2007</a>) and, in particular, underlines the importance  of context (<a href="paper535.html#sav09a">Savolainen 2009a</a>).</p>
 
 <p> Different conceptions and levels of information use calls for a variety of methodological  approaches. The cognitive constructivism view is underlined, for example, in  Brookes’s  fundamental equation (<a href="paper535.html#bro80">1980</a>). Wilson (<a href="paper535.html#wil00">2000</a>: 50) defines information use as '<em>the physical and mental acts involved  in incorporating the information found into the person's existing knowledge base</em>'. Within this tradition the most common research methods aim to capture  the influence of information by exploring expressions of (changing) knowledge through interviews or text analysis. </p>
 
 <p> Through interviews Cole (<a href="paper535.html#col97">1997</a>) found that information use  proceeds as a process from the first information encounter, which needs to be  powerful enough to initiate a consequent information process, to the final effect  of new insights. Studies on information use from a process viewpoint have also  used a combination of text analysis and interviews (see e.g. <a href="paper535.html#tod99">Todd  1999</a>), as detailed processing of information may be difficult to recall  in an interview setting. A possible exception is particularly important insights  which in fact may be recalled very specifically. For example, Cole’s (<a href="paper535.html#col97">1997</a>)  interview studies revealed that doctoral students could remember where on a  page an influential information piece had been found.</p>
 
 <p> Information use as a knowledge construction process often requires a longitudinal  approach in order to capture changing knowledge structures. Todd’s (<a href="paper535.html#tod99">1999</a>;  <a href="paper535.html#tod06">2006</a>) work illustrates this process in his studies on how  consulting information changes knowledge structures. Todd analysed the understanding  of a topic in a stepwise process by comparing evolving texts in a learning process  over time.</p>

<p> In studies on plagiarism the focus in information use is on what people do with  information (<a href="paper535.html#kar07">Kari 2007</a>). Researchers of plagiarism in school  assignments have mainly applied ethnographic methods to shed light on the phenomenon  and extended the view by quantitative analysis of plagiarism and copying in  students’ research papers. McGregor and Streitenberger (<a href="paper535.html#mcg04">2004</a>)  developed a five-level classification for the comparison of texts in student  reports and sources used. This was also applied in a later study by McGregor  and Williamson (<a href="paper535.html#mcg05">2005</a>). The authors contribute by introducing  a model by which to compare the texts of written reports and used sources. The  approach, however, only includes the dimensions of copying and plagiarism and  ignores other aspects of information use in source-based writing.</p>

<p> Perhaps the best way to approach the daunting task of measuring such a wide  and conceptually challenging concept as information use is to operationalize  it in concrete terms within a specific context. Savolainen (<a href="paper535.html#sav09a">2009a</a>)  underlines the importance of considering the context of information use. Expressions  of information may vary depending on the discourse of a particular social setting  and the pragmatic social purpose for which it is produced (<a href="paper535.html#tuo97">Tuominen  and Savolainen 1997</a>). In our case study, the students’ goal was to produce  a factual encyclopaedic text. This meant that the students had to adhere to  the rules of the genre. </p>
 
 <h3> Source-based writing as a reading-to-write task</h3>

<p> Spivey (<a href="paper535.html#spi97">1997</a>: 136) defines the reading-to-write task  as a process whereby a person is concurrently in two roles: in the role of reader  <em>building meaning</em> from a text and in the role of writer <em>building  meaning</em> for a text. <a href="paper535.html#kii13">Kiili, Laurinen, Marttunen and Leu (in  press</a>) call the former process <em>meaning construction</em> and the latter,  knowledge construction. The writer reads others’ texts (sources) but also his/her  own when composing it. Writing starts as a cognitive process while reading in  form of planning how the sources can be used in the text to be written (<a href="paper535.html#spi97">Spivey  1997</a>: 144-145). Rouet (<a href="paper535.html#rou06">2006</a>: 91-92) raises an important  challenge for building meaning from sources. Within the task constraints, the  reader seldom has a chance to carefully read all documents to build complete  meaning from them. Rather, he or she has to search for relevant pieces of information  from documents and at the same time derive justified arguments from sources.</p>

<p> Making a synthesis across sources is more demanding than writing a summary of  a single text (<a href="paper535.html#dav97">Davis-Lenski and Johns 1997</a>, <a href="paper535.html#mat09">Mateos  and Sol&eacute; 2009</a>). In <em>summarizing</em> a single text it is possible to maintain  the structure of the original text. The <em>synthesis</em> of multiple texts  requires an integrating idea of how to transform information from differently  structured, even contradictory, texts into a new structure. The synthesis  requires knowledge transformation to a greater extent than does making a summary  (<a href="paper535.html#mat09">Mateos and Sole 2009</a>; <a href="paper535.html#seg04">Segev-Miller 2004</a>).</p><p> In the experimental settings used in reading-to-write studies (see <a href="paper535.html#spi97">Spivey  1997</a>; <a href="paper535.html#seg04">Segev-Miller 2004</a>; <a href="paper535.html#wil99">Wiley and Voss  1999</a>), students are typically given two or more source texts and asked to  write their own texts on the basis of their readings. In recent studies focused  on new literacies, students have been given a similar task but unlimited access  to internet sources (<a href="paper535.html#kii08">Kiili <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>;  <a href="paper535.html#kii13">Kiili, <em>et al.</em> in press</a>). Researchers collect and analyse<br> data on the process and the resulting texts.</p>

<p> Spivey (<a href="paper535.html#spi97">1997</a>: 149-163) gives a description of the classic  method of reading-to-write studies which analyses the relationships between  sources and texts written. She parsed source texts and texts written by students’  into propositions called content units. On the basis of this semantic representation,  for example, unique and overlapping contents of source texts as well as source  texts and written texts could be identified. The analysis of texts at the level  of propositions requires huge resources as the number of texts increases and  is not feasible in a typical school assignment situation of multiple writing  topics and information sources.</p>

<p>Wiley and Voss (<a href="paper535.html#wil99">1999</a>) introduce a more realistic approach in terms of research economics. They conducted a controlled experiment where 
 students wrote essays on historical themes based on a given set of textbook and web-like sources. They classified the origin of each sentence in essays 
 using a three-category scheme. A sentence was coded as, 

<ol>
 <li> <em>borrowed</em>, if it was taken directly or paraphrased from the sources</li>
 <li> <em>transformed</em>, if it contained source-based and novel information  combined or connected two or more pieces of information from sources</li>
 <li> <em>added</em>, if it contained only novel information beyond the sources.</li>
</ol>

<p>The scheme is quite simple but works as a point of departure  in developing a more elaborated framework for text transformations.</p>

<h3>Pilot study</h3>

<p>A pilot study by Sormunen and Lehti&ouml; (<a href="paper535.html#sor11">2011</a>) introduced a  method for the analysis of text transformations which could be applied in a  setting where students are free to use any number of sources in writing their  texts. The fact that students may not cite all used sources was taken into account  and a plagiarism check was included in the method’s procedure. A one-dimensional  categorization for sentence-level text transformations was introduced: <em>copy-pasting; near copy-pasting; paraphrasing; summarizing from a single source and synthesising  across sources</em>.</p>
 
<p> The use of the proposed method was demonstrated in a data set of eleven short Wikipedia  articles and seventy sources used in writing them. One limitation of the coding scheme was that it merged two variables – the degree of paraphrasing  and the degree of information synthesis – into a single dimension. The original  coding scheme introduced no credibility measure for the use of sources. Further,  the analysis was made totally on sentences excluding broader text structures such as paragraphs. A text paragraph could be a relevant unit of analysis, for  example, in investigating the writer’s overall tendency to synthesise information across sources. </p>
 
 <h2>Method proposed and text transformation dimensions</h2>

<p>In this section, the domain of the proposed method and its procedure are described  along the lines suggested by Newell (<a href="paper535.html#new69">1969</a>) for representing  operational methods. The interim coding scheme used to demonstrate the method  is introduced at the end of the section. The third main element suggested by  Newell for representing methods – justifications - is presented in the discussion  section after the case study. </p>

<h3>Domain of the method </h3>

<p>The aim of the proposed method is to reveal the extent to which students paraphrase, acknowledge sources and synthesise information in source-based writing – a typical assignment in information literacy instruction. The method is intended for scholars for the purpose of analysing source-based texts. </p>

<h3>Procedure of the method</h3>

<p>The procedure of the method proposed is illustrated in Figure 1. The first step is to collect all sources students used in writing their texts. In addition to cited sources, it is important to identify intentionally plagiarised or otherwise unacknowledged sources. Collecting materials for the analysis consists of five main steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li>All articles and sources cited in them are collected in electronic form if possible.</li>
 <li>The articles are split into sentences and stored in an appropriate tabular format (e.g., Microsoft Word table).</li>
 <li>The analyst poses a question for each sentence: 'From which sources and from which parts of those sources was this piece of information derived?' Matching is first attempted to sources appearing closest as in-text citations. In case of no match, searching is spread to all sources mentioned in the list of references. Search strategies are source type dependent. In electronic sources keyword searching is an efficient way to find the relevant fragments of text. If paraphrasing is extensive, careful reading of sources is needed to find matches. Relevant text extracts from matching sources or pointers to these are stored in the table adjacent with the sentence.</li>
 <li> If a sentence does not match any of the cited sources, the next step is to do a plagiarism search in the Web. Systematically varied queries using basic search tools such as Google and Wikipedia or special services for plagiarism checking can be used.</li>
 <li>If a substantial share of the article’s text still lacks matching sources, it is reasonable to search for them outside the public Web. This may include  textbooks used in the school, materials of the school’s learning environment or other materials available to the students. The success in the plagiarism search outside the public Web is heavily dependent on contextual and situational factors. Data collected about the task performance process, for example by observation  and interviews, help in focusing search efforts. </li> 
</ol>

<p>The comparison of a sentence and sources is based on the analysis of literal and semantic content. Finding a match is a simple task in case of copy-pastes but becomes more challenging when the author extensively uses his or her own terminology and synthesises across sources. Another problem is that similar information may be available through several sources. The analyst must assess if the sentence could be formulated using one source only. An opposite problem is that the sentence can only be composed by combining information from several sources. Occasionally it occurs that no matching sources are found for a sentence. The percentage of sentences for which sources are found is named here <em>source recall</em>.</p>

<h3>Text transformation categories</h3>

<p>The categories for the text transformations developed in the pilot study combined  ideas applied in plagiarism and reading-to-write studies (Sormunen and Lehtiö  2011). The framework was very simple and merged two variables, the degree of  paraphrasing and the degree of synthesis, into one-dimensional scale. The framework  proposed here consists of six dimensions (variables). Four variables are related  to the use of sources, one to the type of sentence written and one to the type  of sources used. The dimensions are the following (sources which informed the  development of categories are mentioned in parentheses): </p> 

<ol>

 <li>The degree of paraphrasing (<a href="paper535.html#mcg04">McGregor and Streitenberger 2004</a>; <a href="paper535.html#wil99">Wiley and Voss 1999</a>)</li>
 <li> The degree of synthesis (<a href="paper535.html#mat09">Mateos and Sole 2009</a>; <a href="paper535.html#seg04">Segev-Miller 2004;</a> <a href="paper535.html#spi97">Spivey 1997</a>)</li>
 <li>Credibility in building arguments on the basis of sources (inspired by <a href="paper535.html#har98">Hart 1998</a>)</li>
<li>Accuracy of citing (plagiarism: <a href="paper535.html#mcg04">McGregor and Streitenberger 2004</a>; other categories derived from the data)</li>
 <li>Statement type (inspired by <a href="paper535.html#har98">Hart 1998: 89-93</a>)</li>
 <li> Source type (any typology for formal information sources applies)</li>
</ol>

<p>The degree of paraphrasing indicates how much the writer uses his or her own words 

in constructing meaning for the text (categories: <em>copy-paste, near copy-paste, paraphrased, own text, and  'not applicable'</em>). Copy-pastes are exact copies and near copy-pastes slightly edited copies of the source text (e.g., word order changed, some words added or removed). <em>Paraphrasing</em> requires a major change beyond technical editing in expressing the content of the source. <em>Own text</em> refers to sentences which are comments or remarks made by the writer. Informative sentences likely to be derived from unknown sources are assigned to category <em>not applicable</em>. </p>

<p>The degree of synthesis measures the extent to which the writer connects bits of information from different parts of a single source or from multiple sources (categories: <em>sentence, paragraph, source,  multiple sources, combined with own text, not applicable</em>). <em>Sentence, paragraph, source</em> means that a written sentence contains or summarizes information from a single sentence, a single text paragraph or several paragraphs of a single source. <em>Multiple sources</em> means that information is derived from two or more sources. <em>Combined with own text</em> indicates that the sentence is partially based on sources and partially on the writer’s own knowledge or views. </p>

<p>In the study of credibility dimension the aim is to assess how solidly arguments expressed in a sentence base on the evidence presented in the sources used (categories: <em>credible, ambiguous, error, weak source, not applicable</em>). The goal is not to assess the <em>truth</em> or <em>correctness</em> of information. <em>Ambiguous</em> means that the writer fails to represent the piece of information derived from the source clearly, thus increasing the risk that the reader acquires biased or faulty facts or interpretations. <em>Error</em> denotes a definite logical error in interpreting the source and weak source indicates that the quality of the source is dubious. </p>

<p>Accuracy of citing deals with the punctuality of linking the written sentence to sources used (<em>categories: sentence, paragraph, article, other, plagiarism, cheating, not applicable</em>). Categories <em>sentence, paragraph, article, and other</em> express how close to the sentence the corresponding in-text citation is located. Category <em>plagiarism</em> denotes that one or more non-cited sources were found for the sentence. In the case of <em>cheating</em> the writer has plagiarised a source but given a reference to a inapplicable source. </p>

<p>Dimension <em>Statement type</em> introduces a simple idea to apply argumentation analysis in categorizing sentences written by students. We applied the typology of claims introduced by Hart (<a href="paper535.html#har98">1998: 89-93</a>) and propose the following categories: <em>claims of concept</em> (definitions), <em>claims of fact</em> (<em>objective</em> facts), <em>claims of interpretation</em> (<em>subjective</em> facts), <em>claims of value, technical comments</em>. <em>Claims of fact</em> refers to statements that can be proven true or false (e.g. ‘Helsinki is the home base of many leading Finnish export industries.’). <em>Claims of interpretation</em> are proposals as to what facts mean (e.g. ‘Helsinki has a major role in Finland’s economy’). <em>Claims of value</em> are judgements about the worth of something. </p>

<p>Source type expands the view on materials exploited by the writer. The relevance of categories depends on the context of writing. For example, one may apply main categories of printed and Web sources and their subcategories. </p>

<h2>Case study</h2>

<h3>Research questions</h3>

<p>The goal of the empirical part of the study is to demonstrate how the method proposed can be applied to the analysis of text transformations. The main research question is: How do the students of an upper secondary school use information derived from sources in writing an article as a collaborative learning assignment?</p>

<p>We look for answers to the main question from several viewpoints by formulating the following sub-questions:</p>

<p>Research question 1. To what extent do texts composed by students in collaborative source-based writing contain sentences</p> 

<ul style="list-style-type:lower-latin;">

 <li>paraphrasing beyond copy-pasting?</li>
 <li>summarising within and synthesising across sources?</li>
 <li>plagiarising sources?</li>
 <li>building arguments credibly on sources?</li>
 <li>expressing claims of facts and interpretation?</li>
</ul>

<p>Research question 2. Is the use of printed and web sources similar or different in terms of</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:lower-latin;">
 <li>copy-pasting?</li>
 <li>plagiarism? </li>
 <li>summarising within and synthesising across sources?</li>
 <li>building arguments credibly on sources?</li>
 <li>expressing claims of facts and interpretation?</li>
</ul>

<p>Research question 1 demonstrates how the method can be used to make a descriptive study on the different aspects of texts written by students. Research question 2 expands the analysis to the relationship of the text aspects and source types. </p>

<h3>Case courses</h3>

<p>Data were collected from two eight-week courses in an upper secondary school in the city of Tampere, Finland, during the spring term 2011. Thirty students organized into ten groups (three members in each) completed a course in Finnish literature. Twenty-eight students organized into seven groups completed a course in Finnish history: two three-member, three four-member and two five-member groups. The members were allocated into groups randomly by lot. </p>

<p>On the literature course, the task was to write an article for the Finnish edition of Wikipedia. The history course used a dedicated school wiki as the writing forum. On both courses, the assignment was designed to follow Wikipedia’s conventions and requirements for authors. The student groups selected a topic for their article from a list prepared by the teacher. </p>

<p>On the literature course each assignment was about a classic Finnish novel. The students were required to read the novel first and then write a personal literary essay about it before the group work started. The teams were required to write about the novel, about the author and his or her works overall, about the reception of the novel in its time, etc. </p>

<p>On the history course, the teacher had prepared topics dealing with Finnish history from the Civil War to the beginning of the Winter War (1918-1939). The topics were quite extensive: The Civil War (1918), a dispute over the Finnish constitution (1918-19), economic development, the role of the left wing, the role of the right wing and foreign policy. The articles on the last four topics were intended to cover the period 1918-39. For each topic, the teacher had listed sub-topics to help students comprehend what the article should contain.</p>

<p>The total time reserved for the assignment was thirteen days in the history class and thirty days in the literature class (including time for reading the novel and preparing the literary essay). On both courses the assignment was introduced, written guidelines were distributed, groups formed, and topics for the articles selected at the first meeting. The second meeting was a visit to the nearby city library. One thirty-minute lesson was devoted to the library collections and services and another lesson to searching in the internet. The librarian was informed of the topics selected and had collected materials from the library collection for the students to look at. </p>

<p>After the visit to the library the students worked the next five (in the history course four) lessons in the computer class to search for information, to select and read sources found and to write text for the articles under the teacher’s supervision. On the history course a substitute teacher was supervising the class for two lessons instead of the regular teacher. </p>

<h3>Data collection</h3>

<p>This article only reports findings on the text analysis. The data from the main study, however, include a rich material consisting, for instance, of student interviews 
and questionnaires. In the process of text analysis the interview material was occasionally consulted to aid in finding information sources.</p>

<p>Two second-year Master’s degree students were hired as research assistants. One of them was studying Finnish literature and the other history. We aimed to ensure 
that both analysts had enough background knowledge in the subject area of articles and sources for consistent and informed decisions.</p>

<p>All articles written by the students were split into sentences and stored into Microsoft Word tables. For each sentence, the sources used were searched starting from 
the closest text citations and expanding to plagiarism tests in the Web. If a substantial share of article sentences still lacked identified sources (&gt; 10%) we checked the textbooks available to the students and the materials mentioned by students in the interviews. Relevant extracts from the sources identified were stored
in the table of sentences.</p>

<p>Plagiarism checking was mainly done by Google and Wikipedia searches. To avoid the problems of variation in text transformations we selected up to four “best” words from each sentence as keyword candidates for Wikipedia searches. Queries were made with all permutations of two keywords (maximum of six queries if necessary). A similar procedure was applied in Google searches but a set of five keyword candidates was used first. The queries were made using all keywords and combinations of four keywords (maximum five attempts). In each search result, a set of twenty first hits was checked. If more than ten per cent of sentences were still missing a source, the plagiarism search was expanded to printed materials mentioned in the student group interviews. </p>

<h3>Data analysis</h3>

<p>The research assistants familiarised themselves with the task by applying the codes to one article in their own area of expertise (literature or history). On the basis of the problems encountered the codes and coding guidelines were revised. Next, both research assistants independently coded a set of two articles (literature and history) as the first consistency test. The differences in codes were analysed and the definitions and interpretations of some codes were discussed and revised. The level of consistency was again checked by coding a new set of two articles. The overall consistency in the first round was 79-82% and rose  to 91-95%in the final round (Table 1).</p>

<p>After the consistency tests each research assistant coded the data of her/his course alone. To balance the workload one of the history articles was analysed by the literature expert. The summary of data analysed is presented in Table 2. The volume of texts analysed in the set of literature articles was smaller because we excluded sections based on the direct literary analysis of the novel (description of the plot and characters). The third column of the table indicates in how many sentences the analyst was unable to identify the source of the sentence. The overall share of sentences where the search for sources failed was about 6 per cent for history articles and about 11 per cent for literature articles. The coding data was first collected into Excel tables and after error-checks and pre-processing transferred into SPSS software. All variables to be examined were categorical and thus the data were organized into 2 x 2 or 2 x 3 contingency tables. The chi-squared (&chi;<sup>2</sup>) measure was used to test the statistical significance of differences in the distributions of column and row frequencies. This has been applied to cross-tabulated categorical data (<a href="paper535.html#rei06">Reinhard 2006</a>.) The &chi;<sup>2</sup> test can be used if <em>N</em> &gt; 40, if fewer than 20% of the cells have an expected frequency of less than 5 and if no cell has an expected frequency of less than 1 (<a href="paper535.html#sie88">Siegel and Castellan 1988: 123-124</a>). We used <em>p&lt;0.05</em> as the critical limit for statistical significance.</p>

<p>The Cram&eacute;r coefficient (<em>V</em>) was used as the measure of association between column and row variables. The advantages of the coefficient are that it can be used to compare contingency tables of different sizes and based on different sample sizes (<a href="paper535.html#sie88">Siegel &amp; Castellan 1988: 232</a>). In principle, the values range from 0 to 1 but rarely achieve a value higher than 0.80. We used the following criteria adopted from Rea and Parker (1997) to evaluate the values of <em>V</em>: 0.10 = no relationship; 0.10 … &lt;0.20 = weak association; 0.20 … &lt;0.40 = moderate association (no higher values found in this study). </p>

</table><p><strong>Degree of paraphrasing.</strong> Overall, slightly more than a half of the sentences were written in paraphrased form and the share of copy-pasted text was 9%. Copy-pasting was equally common in both assignment groups but paraphrasing was more typical in the literature assignments (65%) than in the history ones (49%). The difference in the distributions between groups was statistically significant (&chi;<sup>2</sup>(2)=23.5; p=0.000) but the degree of association was weak (V = 0.158).</p>

<p>

<strong>Degree of synthesis.</strong> The results showed that most sentences written (58%) 
were derived from a single sentence in the source. About one third of sentences 
(35%) summarised the content of a single source. Seven per cent of sentences synthesise 
contents from two or more sources. A small but statistically significant difference 
was observed between the groups (&chi;<sup>2</sup>(2)=10.8; p=0.004). The students 
on the literature course showed a tendency to summarise and synthesising more 
actively (weak association, <em>V</em> = 0.107).</p>

<p><strong>Accuracy of citing.</strong> The overall result was that a text citation was assigned 
to 60% of sentences at the level of sentence or text paragraph. In about 
a quarter of sentences (24%) the source was in the list of references but no in-text 
citation was used to explicitly link the sentence to the sources. In 16% 
of sentences the source was plagiarised. The history group was more meticulous 
in marking text citations (&chi;<sup>2</sup>(2)=28.3; p=0.000) but the degree 
of association was weak (<em>V</em> = 0.173) . The most interesting result was 
that plagiarism was equally common in both groups (16%).</p>

<p><strong>Credibility of arguments.</strong> The results showed that the students built 
their arguments well on the sources. In 85% of sentences, we could not 
find even minor problems in students’ ways of interpreting the content of sources. 
The difference measured between courses was not statistically significant. </p>

<p><strong>Type of claims.</strong> Overall, a high percentage of text (60%) reproduced facts from 
sources. More than a third of sentences (37%) contained source-based interpretations 
of facts. Only three per cent of sentences contained a definition or a claim of 
value. The comparison of group distributions suggested that the history group 
focused more on facts (67% vs. 31%) and the literature group on the interpretation 
of facts (45% vs. 52%). The difference measured was statistically significant 
(&chi;<sup>2</sup>(2)=40.0; p=0.000) and the degree of association 
moderate (<em>V</em> = 0.206).</p>

<p><em>RQ2: Is the use of information similar in printed and web sources? </em></p>


<p>The characteristics of texts written on the basis of printed and web sources are 
presented in Table 3 above. Twenty-nine sentences synthesising information from 
both printed and web sources were excluded from the basic data set reducing it 
to 916 sentences. The exclusion especially affected the distributions in the degree 
of synthesis. </p>

<p><strong>Degree of paraphrasing.</strong> The figures reveal the tendency towards direct 
copy-pasting in the use of Web sources (14% vs. 5%) and towards paraphrasing in 
the use of printed sources (57% vs. 48%). Slight technical transformations were 
equally common (38%) in the use of both source types. The differences measured 
in copy-pasting and paraphrasing were statistically significant (&chi;<sup>2</sup>(2)=21.8; 
p=0.000). The result suggests that students exploited the technical ease of copying 
web sources (weak association, <em>V</em> = 0.154).</p>

<p><strong>Degree of synthesis.</strong> We could not reject the null hypothesis concerning the degree 
of synthesis in students’ articles (&chi;<sup>2</sup>(2)=0.125; p=0.939). The students seemed 
to summarise and synthesise information at a similar rate both from printed and 
web sources.</p>

<p><strong>Accuracy of citing.</strong> The results corroborate the generally shared observation 
that plagiarism is associated especially with the use of web sources. Twenty-nine 
per cent of sentences making use of Web sources were products of plagiarism while 
this remained at the level of 5% in texts relying on printed sources (&chi;<sup>2</sup>(2)=97.7; p=0.000). The degree of association was moderate (<em>V</em> = 0.327). 
</p>

<p>If we exclude plagiarised sentences, the type of source did not seem to affect 
the accuracy of citing. Text citations were close to the sentence in 71-72% and 
loose in 28-29% of cases both for printed and web sources (&chi;<sup>2</sup>(2)=0.116; 
p=0.733). </p>

<p><strong>Credibility of arguments.</strong> No difference was observed between source types 
in the credibility of building arguments (&chi;<sup>2</sup>(1)=0.747; p=0.388).</p>

<p><strong>Type of claims.</strong> The analysis of sentence types written revealed a tendency 
to collect more facts from the Web (65% vs. 55%) while interpretations of facts 
were more commonly derived from printed sources (42% vs. 33%). Other types of 
sentences had a minor role and do not affect the general trend. The difference 
measured was statistically significant (&chi;<sup>2</sup>(2)=8.3; <em>p</em>=0.015) 
but the difference observed was hardly of practical importance (<em>V</em> = 0.095, 
no relationship). </p>

<h3>Discussion of empirical findings</h3>

<p>The findings of the present study demonstrate that the proposed method enables 
a detailed analysis of the use of sources in writing assignments. We discuss some 
of the findings to explicate our contribution.</p>

<p><strong>Research question 1</strong>, The answers to the first research question emphasize that students 
used sources and transformed information differently in differently profiled assignments 
(see subsection <em>Case courses</em>). However, we cannot draw any conclusion 
on which of the differences in the assignment characteristics caused the differences 
in the written outcomes. On the other hand, the results also suggest that some 
specific information practices were similar across the courses. All the students 
were from the same school, the groups were large and the courses were compulsory 
for all students (no pre-selection). Thus shared practices could be associated 
with the particular school and schooling there.</p>

<p>Two interesting similarities were observed in the articles written on the two 
courses. The groups composed copy-pasted (9%) and plagiarised (16%) sentences 
equally often. The finding suggest that copy-pasting and plagiarism are deeply 
integrated into the practice of schooling (<em>school culture</em>) and these behaviours 
are not sensitive to minor changes in the way source-based writing assignments 
are designed and introduced (cf. <a href="paper535.html#lim08">Limberg <em>et al.</em>2008</a>).</p>

<p>In other practices of source-based writing we identified differences between the 
courses. In the literature assignment, the students were more active in paraphrasing, 
in summarising and synthesising and in writing interpretative sentences beyond 
reproducing facts. The students of the history class were behind in all three 
aspects of source-based writing but they cited sources more carefully. </p>

<p>We can only present some preliminary hypotheses on the reasons why the articles 
on the literature course were more advanced in terms of certain evaluation criteria. 
The design of the literature assignment was more focused (the classic novel anchored 
the topic for each student team). The personal essay prepared students for searching 
information and writing the article. The structure and content of the required 
end-product were more explicitly specified (a Wikipedia article of a particular 
type), and the progress of groups was monitored more intensively (checkpoints, 
the regular teacher was present at all lessons). Earlier research suggests that 
keeping the contextual aspects of the assignment simple and fixed seems to help 
students to focus on the contents of the assignment and achieve better outcomes 
(cf. <a href="paper535.html#lim08">Limberg <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>; <a href="paper535.html#hon10">Hongisto &amp; 
Sormunen 2010</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Research question 2</strong>. The comparison of information use derived from printed and Web sources suggests 
that 1) copy-pasting instead of paraphrasing, 2) plagiarism instead of acknowledging 
sources and 3) sentences reproducing facts instead of interpretations are more 
common when using Web sources. However, the findings are not conclusive since 
we did not eliminate the effect of assignment type (students in the literature 
class used more printed sources). No difference was found in the degree of synthesis 
or in the credibility of building arguments on sources. The findings exemplify 
the commonly held view that the Web has an obvious role in inappropriate practices 
of source-based writing (cf. e.g. <a href="paper535.html#mcg05">McGregor and Williamson 2005</a>; 
<a href="paper535.html#pur10">Purdy 2010</a>).</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>The method proposed was developed for the analysis of texts composed by students 
in source-based writing assignments. It is possible that some parts of it could 
be automated and applied by teachers in the assessment of students’ texts. It 
is also possible that the area of application could be extended to other kinds 
of texts composed in source-based writing. However, we focus here on justifying 
the method only in the original application context.</p>

<p> The <em>appropriateness</em> of a method for the use intended can be justified, 
 for example, by showing that it is possible to study new types of research questions 
 or address old research questions in a more fruitful way. The review of related 
 research revealed that studies on information use have not penetrated to the 
 level of text transformations. Researchers in reading-to-write studies have 
 applied similar text analysis but only in experimental settings and the focus 
 has been different (e.g. <a href="paper535.html#rou06">Rouet 2006</a>; <a href="paper535.html#wil99">Wiley 
and Voss 1999</a>). The findings of the case study demonstrated the nature 
 of empirical questions that would be beyond the reach of commonly used data 
 collection approaches such as observations, interviews or questionnaires, but 
 could be tackled by the method developed. </p>

<p>The <em>validity</em> of the method means that it is based on an established interpretation 
of essential variables in the phenomenon observed. The core variables and their 
operationalization were introduced in the framework of text transformation categories. 
We adopted most of the categories from reading-to-write studies (e.g. <a href="paper535.html#wil99">Wiley 
and Voss 1999</a>), plagiarism studies (e.g.<a href="paper535.html#mcg04"> McGregor and
Streitenberger 2004</a>) and argument analysis (<a href="paper535.html#har98">Hart 1998</a>) 
although clarification and redefinition were required. The framework of transformation 
categories is open to extensions.</p>

<p>The <em>reliability</em> of the method is obviously sensitive to the level of 
source recall (the percentage of sentences for which sources were successfully 
found) and to the consistency of coding. In the case study, source recall was, 
on average, 94% (history course) and 89% (literature course). These figures are 
quite high and indicate that the findings would only have changed slightly if 
sources had been found for all sentences. The 6% or 11% of the used sources that 
could not be found is a possible warning sign of potentially poor citing practices. 
Extensive paraphrasing may also decrease source recall. However, paraphrasing 
should have a minor effect on source recall. If the reader of a text cannot see 
the content connection to the source, the writer has deviated from the good practice 
of source-based writing. The other aspect of reliability, consistency of coding 
was high in the case study: about 79-82% in the first test and 91-95% in the second test. </p>

<p>The<em> efficiency</em> of the procedure is a relative issue. The case study indicated 
that the method could be used successfully by exploiting the limited resources 
of a research project. Two research assistants each worked for twelve weeks for twenty hours 
a week The project paid for 480 hours in total (three months). We 
consider this a reasonable investment in the data. </p>

<p>The limitations of the method include its exclusive focus on text analysis. For 
a more thorough understanding of the use of sources it would be beneficial to 
include e.g. interviews with students which could shed light on specific behaviours 
detected through the text analysis. Interviews would also afford an opportunity 
to verify the researchers’ selection of sources. A further extension of the method 
could include asking students to record the keywords they used in their searches, 
or automatically recording their searches. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>We have introduced a novel method for the analysis of text transformations and 
information use in source-based writing. The appropriateness, validity, reliability 
and efficiency of the method were discussed above. We argue that the method opens 
up new possibilities for studying the core aspects of information use by focusing 
on text transformation from sources to written texts. The case study demonstrates 
that the method can be used productively in examining not only copy-pasting and 
plagiarism but also higher level text transformations such as the synthesis of 
information and quality of arguments.</p>

<p>No single method solves the problems of studying a complex phenomenon such as 
information use in source-based writing. One direction is to develop methods for 
more ambitious studies that codes for evidence of a critical view of the information 
from different sources, for example, in comparing and contrasting two sources, 
or a cause and effect from two sources. </p>

<p>The study of the end-product calls for approaches to study the process of source-based 
writing. In the case study, we collected a rich set of interview and survey data 
and look forward to combining different data sets to further elaborate information 
use in school assignments. </p>
