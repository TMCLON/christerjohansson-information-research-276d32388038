 <section>
 
<h2>Introduction</h2> 
 
 <p>Being
a relatively new management tool in the business world, competitive
intelligence plays an important role to support managers today for
better decision making and strategic planning. Competitive intelligence
is defined as a systematic and ethical programme for gathering,
analysing, and managing information about the present and future
behaviour of competitors, suppliers, customers, technologies,
government, acquisitions, market and general business environment (<a href="paper552.html#ved00">Vedder and Guynes 2000 </a>).
Businesses today have some sort of competitive intelligence practices,
whether conducted formally or not. Cases occur where competitive
intelligence brings positive impacts on firm performance in different
areas, for instance, Merck &amp; Co., NutraSweet, Texas Instrument,
Shell, East Kodak Company, Motorola, AT&amp;T, Metropolitan Life
Insurance Company, Marion Merrell Dow, FMC &amp; Corning (<a href="paper552.html#gil89">Gilad  1989 </a>; <a href="paper552.html#rou01">Rouach and Santi 2001</a>).
Despite the increasing importance of competitive intelligence in
businesses, there are few systematic attempts to investigate the
relationship between competitive intelligence practices and its
antecedents and consequences. Previous studies reveal that current
evidence of the value and impact of competitive intelligence is
anecdotal or consists of indirect assessment (<a href="paper552.html#mcg02">McGonagle and Vella 2002</a>).
The existing empirical studies are mostly from the Western countries
with limited studies from the emerging economies. Therefore, this paper
aims to investigate the level of competitive intelligence practices
undertaken by Malaysian companies and examine whether a difference
exists in competitive intelligence practices between companies that
adopt different organizational strategy.</p>

<p>This paper proceeds as follows. The next section reviews the
foundation concepts of organizational strategy and past empirical
studies with respect to competitive intelligence practices and its link
to organizational strategy. The third section describes sampling
procedures, data collection method, and variables and measurement, and
the fourth section presents results and discussions. The paper
concludes with an examionation of implications, limitations, and
recommendations for future studies.</p>

<h2>Review of the literature</h2>
<h3>Organizational strategy</h3>
<p>The word strategy was derived from the Greek word <em>strategos</em> which means the art of the [military] general (<a href="paper552.html#coh04">Cohen 2004:10</a>).
The concept of strategy was introduced into organizational literature
and advanced most notably during the 1950s by the Harvard Business
School (<a href="paper552.html#mil78">Miles and Snow 1978</a>; <a href="paper552.html#sno80">Snow and Hambrick 1980</a>). There is no single, universally accepted definition of strategy in the literature. Hambrick (<a href="paper552.html#ham80">1980: 567</a>)
defined strategy as a pattern in a stream of important decisions that
guides the organization in its relationships with its environment,
affects the internal structure and processes of the organization and
centrally affects the organization's performance. Strategy can also be
defined normatively, that is the content of a strategy should include
the company's basic image, purposes, fields of present and future
activities, and expected future position in these fields (<a href="paper552.html#agu67">Aguilar 1967: 4</a>).</p>
 
<p>In conceptualizing organizational strategy, Miles and Snow (<a href="paper552.html#mil78">1978: 153</a>)
portrayed business as continuously cycling through set of decisions on
three broad problem areas which constantly confront management: the
entrepreneurial problem - what products or services and market should
the organization select; the engineering problem - what is the
appropriate process or technology for assembling and delivering the
product or services; the administrative problem - what should be the
structure and managerial processes for controlling and coordinating the
activities of the organization. Based on research in four industries,
they distinguished groups of companies that deal with the three
problems in a relatively similar manner. The respective groups may be
designated as strategic typologies - <em>prospector, defender, and analyser</em>. </p>

<p>The three effective strategic types are neither inferior nor
superior among themselves. Each type has its own unique strategy for
relating to its chosen market, a particular configuration of
technology, structure, managerial process, risks and power distribution
that is consistent with its market strategy. It means any three
strategic types will perform well so long as their strategy
implementation is effective. <em>Defenders</em> have narrow product
domain, compete primarily based on price, quality and services. They
focus on tight control and cost efficiency and pay less emphasis on
technological changes. As such, the organizational structure tends to
be more formalized and centralized to facilitate intensive planning. <em>Prospectors</em>
focus on new market opportunities and compete primarily through new
product innovation. They attempt to be the first mover in the market
and thus ability to capitalize technological changes and research and
development are of utmost importance in determining their success. In
order to adapt to the rapid changing environment, the organizational
structure and administrative system of prospectors is more flexible. <em>Analysers</em>
are the hybrid types of organization, combining the features of
defenders and prospectors. They emphasise production and cost
efficiency while innovations are selectively adopted in promising new
market. As such, they tend to be second mover in the market after
prospectors. The organizational structure tends to be more complex,
integrating centralization and decentralization to suit the different
markets. The fourth type of organization is called the <em>reactor</em>, which is a form of strategic failure in that inconsistencies exist in its strategy, technology, structure, and process (<a href="paper552.html#mil78">Miles and Snow 1978</a>). </p>
 
 <h3>The role of competitive intelligence in strategic activities</h3> 
 
<p>Generally, the role of competitive intelligence in business
organizations can be classified into the following categories: (i)
supporting strategic decision making (<a href="paper552.html#pre89">Prescott and Smith 1989</a>); (ii) identifying early warning of threats and blind spots in business (<a href="paper552.html#gho91">Ghoshal and Westney 1991</a>);
(iii) supporting strategic planning and implementation for marketing,
information technology and research and development activities (<a href="paper552.html#ved02">Vedder and Guynes 2002</a>); (iv) supporting competitor assessment and tracking (<a href="paper552.html#cau94">Caudron 1994</a>); and (v) performing industry benchmarking with competitors (<a href="paper552.html#gel91">Gelb <em>et al.</em> 1991</a>).</p>
<h3>Organizational strategy and competitive intelligence </h3>
<p>The empirical studies conducted specifically on competitive
intelligence are mostly descriptive in nature. Most studies profile the
practices of competitive intelligence in organization across different
countries. Almost all of the studies do not provide empirical evidence
on the relationships between competitive intelligence and its
antecedents and consequences. There is even lesser empirical research
examining the relationship between organizational strategy and
competitive intelligence practices. On the other hand, literature on
environmental scanning, the sister field of competitive intelligence,
is considered more established. Environmental scanning is defined as
the acquisition of information about events, relationships, and trends
in a company's external environment, the knowledge of which would
assist top management in planning the company's future course of action
(<a href="paper552.html#agu67">Aguilar 1967</a>). According to Gilad (<a href="paper552.html#gil89">1989</a>),
the scope of environmental scanning is broader as competitive
intelligence focuses on forces with which an organization transacts.
Calof and Wright (<a href="paper552.html#cal08">2008</a>), on the other hand, regard environmental scanning as the predecessor of competitive intelligence. Rouibah (<a href="paper552.html#roi03">2003</a>)
considered environmental scanning as another term of competitive
intelligence along with early warning system, strategic watch and
business intelligence. As such, the literature on environmental
scanning is considered relevant to competitive intelligence research. </p>

 <p>Reviews
of the literature contend that competitive strategy affect the manners
in which environment scanning activities were conducted. For instance,
past studies adopted either Porter's (<a href="paper552.html#por80">1980</a>) competitive strategy model such as low cost leadership strategy and differentiation strategy (<a href="paper552.html#jen92">Jennings and Lumpkin 1992</a>; <a href="paper552.html#mil89">Miller 1989</a>; <a href="paper552.html#ray01">Raymond <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>), or Miles's and Snow's (<a href="paper552.html#mil78">1978</a>) strategic typology such as prospector, defender, analyser, and reactor (<a href="paper552.html#bea00">Beal 2000</a>; <a href="paper552.html#car95">Cartwright <em>et al.</em>1995</a>; <a href="paper552.html#ham82">Hambrick 1982</a>; <a href="paper552.html#mil88">Miller 1988</a>), or combination of the two (<a href="paper552.html#par97">Parnell 1997</a>, <a href="paper552.html#par00">2000</a>). </p>
 <p>Miller (<a href="paper552.html#mil89">1989</a>)
examined the relationship between Porter's competitive strategies and
strategy making process, including systematic scanning of the
environments, in ninety-eight Canadian firms. He found that innovative
differentiation strategy is significantly associated with all strategy
making variables, including scanning activities which track
technological developments and anticipate competitor and customer
reactions to new products. Particularly, this relationship is more
obvious among the successful companies, as measured by perceptual long
run profitability and its growth. On the contrary, cost leadership
strategy performed very little scanning and market analysis. Cost
leadership allowed only information processing that contributes to
internal efficiency such as cost analysis and scanning for more
efficient method of production. Cost leadership's simplicity and
economy discouraged costly information processing in scanning and
analysis of customer preferences, competitors' innovations, and new
market opportunities. A similar relationship was found in focus
strategy where the relative simplicity of administrative task did not
require much information processing in the form of environmental
scanning. Spontaneous reactions and rules of thumb may suffice in the
focus strategy.</p>

<p>Jennings and Lumpkin (<a href="paper552.html#jen92">1992</a>) studied the
relationships between environmental scanning activities and the
strategy adopted by companies of forty-four chief executives from
savings and loan industry through telephone interviews. The study
adopted Porter's generic strategies of leadership and differentiation,
and opportunities and threats as the dimensions of scanning activities.
They found a significant difference between strategies adopted by
companies and environmental scanning activities, specifically,
organizations with a differentiation strategy engaged in environmental
scanning focusing on opportunities and customers' attitudes evaluation
while cost leadership strategy focuses on evaluation of threats from
competitors and regulators. The finding was consistent with Miller's (<a href="paper552.html#mil89">1989</a>) and was later supported by the studies of Hagen and Amin (<a href="paper552.html#hag95">1995</a>) and Hagen <em>et al.</em> (<a href="paper552.html#hag03">2003</a>) using samples from Egypt and Jordan and by that of Kumar <em>et al.</em> (<a href="paper552.html#kum01">2001</a>) using a hospital sample. </p>

<p>Subramanian <em>et al.</em> (<a href="paper552.html#sub93">1993</a>) examined the
link between strategy and environmental scanning in sixty-eight Fortune
500 manufacturing firms. By using Miles's and Snow's (<a href="paper552.html#mil78">1978</a>) strategic typology and Jain's (<a href="paper552.html#jai84">1984</a>)
environmental scanning phases in terms of its scope, depth, and focus,
they found that the scanning systems used by an organization vary
depending on its strategic orientation, in which <em>prospectors</em> implemented the most advanced scanning systems, followed by <em>analysers</em> and <em>defenders</em>.</p>

<p>Cartwright <em>et al.</em> (<a href="paper552.html#car95">1995</a>) surveyed
seventy-four companies, which are members of the SCIP (Strategic and
Competitive Intelligence Professionals). The study examined whether a
relationship exists between perceived competitive intelligence
usefulness in strategic decision making and strategic orientation of
the firms and specific characteristics of competitive intelligence. The
study found that technical adequacy (quality) and interaction with the
competitive intelligence unit are the major characteristics influencing
the perceived usefulness of competitive intelligence. Project-based
competitive intelligence tends to be perceived useful regardless of
strategic orientation of the firm. However, continuous competitive
intelligence, both comprehensive and focus, was perceived differently
by firms based on their strategic orientation. <em>Prospectors</em> and <em>analysers</em> perceived these comprehensive types of competitive intelligence as more useful than did <em>defenders</em> and <em>reactors</em>.</p>

<p>Walters and Priem (<a href="paper552.html#wal99">1999</a>) investigated the
relationship between business-level strategy and scanning activities
among chief executive officers of 116 single-business manufacturing
firms. In addition to information collected through survey, an
experiment in a field setting was also conducted wherein chief
executive officers responded in their offices to interactive,
computer-delivered information search task. The study found that
business-level strategy was related to the focus of scanning
activities; specifically the differentiators emphasised external
opportunities and thus collected information on market and
technological sectors. On the other hand, cost leaders focused more on
internal capabilities and thus placed more emphasis on political, legal
and economic sectors. The high performing firms matched the external
and internal scanning practices to their business-level strategy.</p>

<p>Kumar <em>et al.</em> (<a href="paper552.html#kum01">2001</a>) examined the
relationship between strategy and scanning as well as the moderating
role of scanning in the strategy- performance relationship in the
health care industry. Data were collected from 159 chief executives of
the hospitals listed on the American Hospital Association Guide. The
sample was heterogeneous in terms of profit orientation, size,
location, age, and ownership. Based on variables developed by Jennings
and Lumpkin (<a href="paper552.html#jen92">1992</a>),the study found that
differentiators focused on environmental scanning activities regarding
opportunities. On the other hand, cost leaders tended to focus on
collecting information regarding threats. organizational performance as
measured by return in new services, success in retaining customers,
profit margin and success in controlling cost was found to be higher in
hospitals which are able to align their environmental scanning focus
and competitive strategy.</p>

<p>Walters <em>et al.</em> (<a href="paper552.html#wal05">2005</a>) examined the
link between the business-level strategy and scanning practices and
internal firm characteristics of eighty-six small manufacturing firms.
The study found that the scanning practices of firms are dependant on
the strategy adopted. In terms of internal scanning efforts, managers
pursuing a cost leadership strategy emphasised on cost control but
managers pursuing a differentiator strategy emphasised on product
research and development, market research and basic engineering. In
terms of scanning effort in external environment sectors,
differentiators placed more emphasis on market sector. However, firms
pursuing either strategy are required to have a challenging balancing
act to perform their scanning activities in order to achieve success.</p>

<p>The above review illustrates the link between organizational
strategy and competitive intelligence practices. The following
hypotheses were proposed for this study:</p>

<blockquote>Hypothesis 1: The amount of competitive intelligence acquisition varies across strategy types. <br> 
Hypothesis 2: The extent of competitive intelligence use in strategic decision making varies across strategy types.</blockquote>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<h3>Sample and procedures</h3>

<p>The study sample was taken from companies listed
on Bursa Malaysia in light of the belief that larger companies would
have a higher possibility of having a formal competitive intelligence
unit as compared to smaller firms and larger companies tend to be
listed companies. One thousand companies were listed on Bursa Malaysia
(formally Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) as at end of 2007, of which 640
on the Main Board, 234 on the Second Board, and 126 on the MESDAQ
market. The final sample excludes those divisions or units of
conglomerates or subsidiary companies where competitive intelligence
practices may be inherited from the main companies. Similarly, all the
holding companies are excluded as they do not conduct any business
activities. A search from the website, which includes Bursa Malaysia
and individual company's websites was conducted to obtain the
corresponding address of each sample. Finally, a total of 900 companies
was selected as the targeted samples in this study.</p>

<p>Of the 900 questionnaire forms sent out, ninety-three were returned
with complete and usable data, a response rate of 10.3%. The
respondents consists of companies from various industry categories.
Trading and service, finance, and industrial product categories
represent half of the total respondents (50%). In terms of
organizational size measured by total number of employee, the largest
company has more than 30,000 employees, while the smallest company has
less than fifty employees. The mean is 2,538 with a standard deviation
of 5,613. A median of 500 was computed for additional information. The
questionnaire was completed by departmental manager (40%), followed by
vice president, general manager, divisional director or chief operating
officer (33%), and chief executive officer or managing director (27%). <em>Analyser</em> is the strategic typology mostly pursued by the sample (45%), followed by <em>defender</em> (26%). Meanwhile, the remaining sample is about equally distributed between <em>prospector</em> (15%) and <em>reactor</em> (14%).<br></p>
<p>In order to check the representativeness of the respondents, the distributions of
organization by industry category in the respondents and sampled companies are
compared. For the industry category, the deviations between the sampled
companies and respondents are less than ±6%, with an exception for Finance
category, where the deviation is -8%. Since almost all deviations are within
±6% range (<a href="paper552.html#ker00">Kerlinger &amp; Lee, 2000</a>), the study suggested that the respondents
are representative of the sampled companies.</p>
<p>As the response rate for the study was considered low, it might have the
possibility that respondents and non-respondents may differ in some significant
manner. Due to the difficulty associated with the identification of
non-respondents’ characteristics in an anonymous research, a wave analysis of
non-response bias was conducted (<a href="paper552.html#rog07">Rogelberg &amp; Stanton, 2007</a>). The procedure
involves comparing early respondents whose survey forms were received within
one month and late respondents whose survey forms were received after a month.
In this study, there are 55 responses that can be classified as early respondents
and 42 as late respondents. Using independent sample <i style="">t</i> test, the results show no significant difference between early
and late respondents on competitive intelligence acquisition and use. Since
late responses proxy non-responses, it can therefore be suggested that
non-response bias will not seriously affect the generalisability of the study findings.</p>

<h3> Variables and measurement</h3>
<h4>Organizational strategy </h4>
<p>The study adopts the  strategic typology of Miles and Snow (<a href="paper552.html#mil78">1978</a>)
because: (1) it is based on empirical evidence in a cross-section of
industries; (2) it is parsimonious for identification of strategic
typologies within a variety of industries; (3) it has made explicit
relationships that might exist between strategy typologies and scanning
activities, which is related to competitive intelligence practices; (4)
it has been extensively applied in the strategy literature and has been
found consistently and strongly supported in different industries,
including hospitals, colleges, banking, industrial products, and life
insurance (<a href="paper552.html#ham83">Hambrick 1983</a>; <a href="paper552.html#mck89">McKee <em>et al.</em> 1989</a>; <a href="paper552.html#sho90">Shortell and Zajac 1990</a>).</p>

<p> Conant <em>et al.</em> (<a href="paper552.html#con90">1990</a>) developed an
instrument that considers each of the elevan adaptive cycles originally
proposed by Miles and Snow. This instrument is considered to be more
appropriate compared to other instruments as it is multi-item scale
covering each of the dimensions with scale consistency and useful for
large samples. Each of the eleven items consists of four responses
representing each of the four strategy types. In determining which type
of strategy typology is adopted by the organizations, a majority-rule
decision structure is applied. Thus, organizations are classified as <em>defenders, prospectors, analysers</em> or <em>reactors</em> based on the archetypal response option that is selected most often. In the case of ties between <em>defender, prospector</em> and/or <em>analyser</em> response options will result in the organization being classified as an <em>analyser</em>, while any tie involving <em>reactor</em> response options will result in the organization being classified as a <em>reactor</em> (<a href="paper552.html#con90">Conant <em>et al.</em> 1990</a>). This instrument has been tested as reliable and valid in many strategy studies (e.g., <a href="paper552.html#des05">DeSarbo <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>; <a href="paper552.html#dye97">Dyer and Song 1997</a>; <a href="paper552.html#par93">Parnell and Wright 1993 </a>).</p>

<h4>Competitive intelligence practices</h4> 

<p>Competitive intelligence practice is conceptualised as having two
dimensions; acquisition and strategic use. For competitive intelligence
acquisition, respondents answer two questions based on the perceived
importance of acquiring competitive intelligence and the frequency of
competitive intelligence acquisition. The type of competitive
intelligence is classified based on both internal and external business
environmental sectors which include customer, competitor, supplier,
technology, regulatory, socio-cultural, economic, human resource,
global, and organization (<a href="paper552.html#daf88">Daft <em>et al.</em> 1988 </a>).
The perceived importance of each competitive intelligence type is
measured along a five-point scale from 1 - not important to 5 - very
important. The frequency of competitive intelligence acquisition is
measured using a five-point scale from 1 - very low to 5 - very high.
The measurement scale and the phrasing of the questions were adopted
from Choo (<a href="paper552.html#cho93">1993</a>) who measured the amount of
environmental scanning by chief executive officers. An index for the
amount of competitive intelligence acquisition is computed by
multiplying the acquisition frequency of competitive intelligence and
the perceived importance ascribed to each type of competitive
intelligence.</p>

<p>For competitive intelligence strategic use, respondents answer two
questions based on the perceived importance of each strategic decision
in their organization, and the frequency of competitive intelligence
use in strategic decision making. Dess and Robinson (<a href="paper552.html#dss84">1984</a>)
define strategic decisions as having a significant impact on the future
state of the firm and/or resulting in the commitment of large amounts
of organizational resources. It is exemplified by development of new
products and purchase of major equipment. It is vital to note that
types of decisions that are strategic in one industry may be less so in
another (<a href="paper552.html#hic86">Hickson <em>et al.</em> 1986</a>) and the
categories do overlap. Again, there is no universally accepted way of
classifying strategic decisions; the study selects eleven strategic
decisions which are adopted from the studies of Mintzberg <em>et al.</em> (<a href="paper552.html#min76">1976</a>), Dean and Sharfman (<a href="paper552.html#dea96">1996</a>), and Culver (<a href="paper552.html#cul06">2006</a>).
The strategic decisions selected are merger and acquisition; strategic
alliance and joint venture; market entry or exit; vertical integration;
capacity expansion; new product and service development;
diversification; divestment or divestiture; technology adoption;
global; and organization. The perceived importance of each strategic
decision is measured along a five-point scale from 1 - not important to
5 - very important. The frequency of competitive intelligence use in
strategic decision making is measured using a five-point scale from 1 -
very low to 5 - very high. The measurement scale and the phrasing of
the questions were adopted from Choo (<a href="paper552.html#cho93">1993</a>) who
measured the amount of information use in decision making by chief
executive officers. Similar to competitive intelligence acquisition, an
index for the extent of competitive intelligence use in strategic
decision making is computed by multiplying the use frequency of
competitive intelligence and the perceived importance ascribed to each
strategic decision.</p>

<h2>Results and discussion</h2>

<h3>Descriptive analysis </h3>

<p>The amount of competitive intelligence acquisition is computed by
multiplying the perceived importance of competitive intelligence
acquisition and frequency of competitive intelligence acquisition. The
ranking of the amount of competitive intelligence acquisition is
similar to that of the frequency, in which customer is ranked first,
followed by competitor, economic and global and technological.
Meanwhile, the amount of competitive intelligence acquisition is lowest
for socio-cultural and human resources. In most cases, the frequency of
acquiring competitive intelligence from a sector is consistent with the
perceived importance of that sector, in which the higher the perceived
importance of the sector, the higher the frequency of acquiring
competitive intelligence from the sector.</p>

<p>The extent of competitive intelligence strategic use is computed by
multiplying the perceived importance of strategic decision and
frequency of competitive intelligence use in strategic decision making.
The sampled companies use competitive intelligence in the greatest
extent when making decision concerning new products and services
development, followed by capacity expansion, strategic alliance, and
market entry or exit. Meanwhile, competitive intelligence is least used
in making decision about divestment and vertical integration. Similar
to competitive intelligence acquisition, the frequency of using
competitive intelligence in making strategic decision is consistent
with the perceived importance of the type of decision, in which the
higher the perceived importance of a strategic decision, the higher the
frequency of using competitive intelligence in making that strategic
decision.</p>

<h3>Hypotheses testing</h3>

<p>In testing the two hypotheses, <em>prospectors</em> and <em>reactors</em> are excluded as the sample size for both groups is below twenty. In addition, <em>reactors</em> have been excluded from the analysis in previous studies as they do not possess a consistent pattern of strategy (<a href="paper552.html#mat00">Matsuno and Mentzer 2000</a>; <a href="paper552.html#son07">Song <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>). Independent sample t-test was used to test the difference in competitive intelligence practices between <em>analysers</em> and <em>defenders</em>. As shown in Table 5, the difference in the amount of competitive intelligence acquisition is higher among <em>analysers</em> and <em>defenders</em>
in all ten sectors but only significant in two out of the ten sectors,
namely the technology and economic sectors. Thus, Hypothesis 1 was
partially supported by the data. It may be argued that, being the
second mover in the market, <em>analysers</em> acquired significantly
higher amount of the competitive intelligence from technology and
economic sectors in order to exploit the technological opportunities
and capitalise on changing economic conditions. One the other hand, the
other environmental sectors are seen as important by all strategic
typologies and, therefore, the amount of competitive intelligence
acquisition is not significantly different between the two types.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the significantly
higher extent of competitive intelligence use is prevalent in eight out of 11
strategic decisions among the <em>analysers</em> as compared to the <em>defenders</em>. As shown
in Table 6, the largest difference is found in technology adoption decision,
followed by market entry/exit, strategic alliance, and new product/service
development. On the other hand, no significant difference is found in decisions
concerning diversification, divestment, and organisation. Similarly, Hypotheis 2
was also partially supported by the data. It may be argued in the way
that strategic decision concerning organisation is viewed as important by both
typologies, the extent of competitive intelligence use is thus insignificant
between the two typologies. On the other hand, <em>analysers</em> are more aggressive in
pursuing new product and service development as well as other expansion
strategies, the extent of competitive intelligence use is significantly higher
than the defenders.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The findings have implications on two perspectives: academic and
managerial. For the academic perspective, this study serves as one of
the earliest empirical studies to examine the relationship between
organizational strategy and competitive intelligence practices. The
findings of this study also confirm the link between organizational
strategy and competitive intelligence practices in which a higher level
of competitive intelligence acquisition in technological and economic
sectors and a greater extent of competitive intelligence use in most of
the strategic decision making is found among <em>analysers</em>. Business organizations that adopt the <em>analyser</em>
strategy may wish to pay greater attention to issues and development
trends of new technological changes and acquire a higher level of
intelligence about this sector. As <em>analysers</em> emphasise
capitalising on the innovativeness of new technology advancement, the
higher level of technology intelligence acquisition enables managers to
use technology intelligence in a greater extent when making strategic
decisions pertaining to technology adoption.</p>
<p>The study also has implications for managers responsible for strategic decision making in organizations pursuing <em> analyser </em>
typology. As competition in the global market intensifies and the pace
of technological change accelerates, managers should initiate and
organize competitive intelligence activities in their organization.
Systematic acquisition of intelligence about the technology and
economic sectors enables managers to better understand the business
situation and enhance the quality of strategic decision making
concerning technology adoption and market expansion. Business
organizations may wish to design and implement a competitive
intelligence system which is capable of systematically capturing
intelligence from internal and external environments. The competitive
intelligence system should be integrated with other enterprise-wide
information systems in order to achieve long term benefits from the
competitive intelligence efforts, specifically in enhancing the quality
of strategic decision making. As competitive intelligence emphasises on
actionable information as compared to other information management
tools, whether the intelligence acquired is subsequently used in
strategic decision making is of utmost importance. Therefore, business
organizations must ensure that competitive intelligence systems will be
able to provide intelligence to the right people at the right time so
that it will be utilised in the relevant strategic decision making.</p>
<p>This study suffers from several limitations. The sample size of this
study is below one hundred and represents only slightly over 10% of the
population. As such, the findings of this study cannot be generalised
across the Malaysian public listed companies, which practise formal
competitive intelligence. Future studies are recommended to increase
the sample size, specifically from the <em>prospectors</em> and <em>reactors</em>,
so that comparison in terms of competitive intelligence practices among
all strategy types will be feasible. This study also does not deal with
all the activities of competitive intelligence cycle besides
competitive intelligence acquisition and strategic use. It would be too
ambitious to cover all the phases of competitive intelligence cycle for
this study, and there is no doubt that the other phases of competitive
intelligence cycle are also important. In order to capture the complete
domain of competitive intelligence practices, future researchers are
recommended to include intelligence planning, analysis, and
dissemination apart from acquisition and strategic use as presented in
this study. Future researchers are also recommended to include
moderating variables such as industry category, business functions, and
firm size as these variables may have some impact on the hypothesized
relationship among the research constructs. When time permits,
longitudinal research is recommended, especially in examining the
causal or probable reciprocal relationship between organizational
strategy and competitive intelligence practices. Functional mangers
constitute the largest proportion in the sample (40%) of this study.
Each functional manager may differ in the competitive intelligence
practices, specifically the amount of competitive intelligence
acquisition and the extent of competitive intelligence use in different
decision making. As the functional managers may focus only on some
particular sectors, some of the survey items may fall outside their
task domain. Moreover, the study could not examine this difference due
to limited responses from each business function. </p>
