  <section>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Spain has evolved into a pluralistic societal space, shared by citizens
of different nationalities who talk different languages and display a
large variety of cultural characteristics. By taking into account
descriptive data of the evolution of the foreign population in Spain,
one can see that the percentage of citizens of foreign origin residing
in Spain has increased from 3.8% in 2002 to 12.2% in 2010,
placing it among the highest ratios in the European Union. By
restricting the analysis to the years 2007 and 2010, aliens in the autonomous communities of Spain has increased in a
way similar to the aforementioned development on the national level
(Figure 1).</p>

<figure class="centre"><img alt="Percentage of alien populations in the Autonomous Communities of SpaIn Comparison of the years 2007 and 2010 "
src="p554fig1.png" height="500" width="717">
<br><strong>Figure 1: Percentage of foreign populations in the autonomous communities of SpaIn comparison of the years 2007 and
  2010</strong></figure>

<p>According to the National Statistics Institute of Spain, the number of
registered foreigners in Spain currently amounted to 5,708,940 on
January 1st, 2010. This number represents 12.2 % of the total
Population of Spain. The autonomous communities with the largest numbers
of registered foreign citizens are, in descending numerical order:
Catalonia (1,193,283), Madrid (1,071,292), the Valencian community
(884,622) and Andalusia (668,093). Regarding the percentage of citizens
of foreign origin in proportion to the respective overall population,
the Balearic (21.9%), the Valencian community (17.3%) and the community
of Madrid (16.6%) feature the leading figures. In contrast, those
communities with the lowest percentages of alien population are, in
ascending order: Extremadura (3.5%), Galicia (3.9%) and
Asturias.</p>

<p>Within the above described context, the Spanish public library network,
a democratic institution for providing services based on the principle
of equal access for all users, may become a bonding tool and contribute
to the social integration of individuals and groups with different
plural cultural identities. From this perspective, it should be
emphasized that since the 1980s, the Library Services to Multicultural
Populations Section of the International Federation of Library
Associations and Institutions (IFLA) has been continuously
compiling specific guidelines for the development of services to ethnic,
linguistic and cultural minorities. In this Section, these
services are included under the term <em>multicultural library services</em>,
including '<em>both the provision of multicultural information to all users
of the library, as well as the provision of library services
specifically targeting traditionally neglected ethnocultural groups</em>' (<a
href="paper554.html#IFLA2005">IFLA 2005</a>).</p>

 <p>In 1998, IFLA published the second revised edition of <em>Multicultural communities: guidelines for library aervice</em>. The general principle described in this
publication is that all ethnic, linguistic and cultural groups, whether they are minority or majority groups, should enjoy a library service at
the same level and with equal criteria. Therefore, the libraries must provide to ethnolinguistic and cultural minorities collections and
services similar to those that are offered to the rest of the respective population. These guidelines provide an egalitarian basis for the
planning of library services and the acquisition of materials appropriate for all community groups, proposing, <em>inter alia</em>, the
following recommendations:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The responsibility for financing and provision of multicultural library services should be stablished with library authorities and
governments. It is further stated that an effective overall service requires some services to be offered centrally.</li>
  <li>The multicultural services should be considered as an integral and ubiquitous part of the entire range of the libraries services,
instead of considering them as separate or additional services to the usual services.</li>
  <li>The library staff should be visible in the ethnic community, language and culture it serves.</li>
  <li>The libraries should acquire materials that reflect the ethnic, linguistic and cultural diversity of the societies they serve and promote harmony and equality among races.</li>
  <li>Libraries, in cooperation with other institutions, should provide, promote or sponsor different activities to help immigrants adjust to their new country of residence, by facilitating the learning of national languages as well as other languages, offering classes on topics such as citizenship, employment, social services, etc., andpromote the dissemination of the minority groups' knowledge and cultures.</li>
  <li>Libraries should participate in community life, helping to organize festivals and other cultural events organized by, and for minority groups.</li>
  <li>Libraries should provide information, referral and retrieval services in the most common languages, especially for those citizens with greater and more immediate needs, such as newly arrived immigrants.</li>
  <li>The whole set of signs sited in the libraries should use international symbols. Forms, regulations, user guides, etc. should be available in the users' language. Likewise, it is advisable to
provide the libraries' promotional materials in the languages of minority group members. </li>
  <li>Libraries should encourage and support the implementation of literacy programmes and the organization of social and cultural activities, such as story-telling, concerts, theatre plays and
exhibitions for all ethnic, linguistic and cultural groups of the community they serve.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Objectives and method</h2>

<p>The fundamental objective of this study is to evaluate the development
of multicultural library services in Spanish public libraries during the
period 2007 to 2010, in comparison with the proposal of the
aforementioned guidelines and recommendations of IFLA. As its
starting point, the study takes into account our previous research, which
describes the planning of these multicultural services in Spanish
libraries until 2007 (<a href="paper554.html#GarciaMoreno2003">Garc&iacute;a Moreno 2003</a>),
(<a href="paper554.html#Garcia2004">Garc&iacute;a L&oacute;pez 2004</a>), (<a href="paper554.html#Garcia2009">Garc&iacute;a
  L&oacute;pez 2009</a>). The study is mainly based on information and data
provided by the coordination units of the Spanish library services, i.e.,
the centralized bodies and/or coordination bodies of the respective
networks for public libraries and public library systems of the
different autonomous communities (library services or
departments, library coordination services or units, regional or centralized
libraries, etc.). </p>

<p>To the collection of data relevant into the study of the year 2010, the
researchers have applied the same elaborate questionnaire model used in
the previous study (<a href="paper554.html#Garcia2009">Garc&iacute;a
  L&oacute;pez 2009</a>). To improve the study's topicality, during
the questionnaire design we considered the latest guidelines for the
development of multicultural library services provided by IFLA.
Based on these guidelines, the questionnaire was divided into three
sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Planning multicultural services</li>
  <li>Development of multicultural resource collections</li>
  <li>Planning intercultural services and activities </li>
</ul>

<p>The questionnaire was e-mailed to respective Library Coordination Units
of each Autonomous Community. Before this mailiong, we first made
contact by telephone conversations, in the course of which the purpose
of the study was explained to the participants. We obtained data from
fifteen autonomous communities, representing 88% of all communities: Andalusia, Aragon, Asturias, Cantabria, Castile&mdash;La Mancha, Castile and Le&oacute;n, Catalonia, the
Valencia, Extremadura, Galicia, La Rioja, Madrid, the Region of Murcia, Navarre, and the Basque Country.</p> 

<h2>Main outcomes of the study </h2>

The planning for multicultural library services in the different autonomous communities is still very diverse. In the following
section, we present the main results of the study, which examines the same issues that were evaluated in the 2007 study (<a href="paper554.html#Garcia2009">Garc&iacute;a
  L&oacute;pez 2009</a>).
  
<h3>Planning multicultural services</h3>

<p>In 2010, the planning of library services remains unaddressed in
  many of the autonomous communities. To date, only nine communities (60%) have carried out some form of initiative for the
  development of these services in their respective library networks.
  This is the case of Andalusia, Aragon, Castile-La Mancha, Castile
  and Le&oacute;n, Catalonia, the Valencian Community, the Community of Madrid,
  the Region of Murcia, and the Basque Country. Considering the data
  collected in 2007, although there still remains a significant
  percentage of communities (40%) who have not taken any initiative in
  this regard, it should be stressed that Aragon and the Basque Country,
  two communities that were still inactive in 2007, have now planned and
  executed multicultural service projects over these past three years.
  At present, most communities have chosen to develop
  specific programmes for the planning of multicultural library
  services, but, as was stated in the 2007 study, in no case the
  implementation of multicultural services has been provided by
  strategic plans of broader reach (Figure 2).</p>
  
<figure class="centre"><img alt="Planning of the execution of Multicultural Service Projects" src="p554fig2.png">
<br><strong>Figure 2: Planning of the execution of multicultural service projects</strong>
</figure>
  
 <p>According to the IFLA Guidelines, the planning of multicultural library
services should be based on sound knowledge of the information needs of
the community the library serves. However, only four communities (26.7%)
(Andalusia, Catalonia, the Community of Madrid and the Community of
Murcia) have conducted several preliminary studies in order to identify
the typology and information needs of the different ethnic, linguistic
and cultural groups that compose the population of their respective
region, which is virtually the same percentage as in 2007. Related to
the funding of multicultural library services, only eight communities
(53.3%) (Andalusia, Aragon, Castile&mdash;La Mancha, Castile and Le&oacute;n,
Catalonia, the Community of Madrid, the Community of Murcia, and the
Basque Country) have planned to provide a budget for the development of
these services in their respective public libraries. This number amounts
to two more communities than in 2007, which corresponds precisely to the
two newly active communities (Aragon and the Basque Country) that have
started planning services between 2007 and 2010.</p> 

<p>Regarding  the
recruitment of employees from diverse backgrounds for library services,
which would faithfully reflect all ethnic, linguistic and cultural
groups represented in the communities that the libraries serve, only
three of the analysed communities (20%) (Catalonia, the Community of
Madrid and the Community of Murcia) have employed personnel of foreign
origin. It should be noted that in 2007, this initiative was provided
for, in two additional communities, Andalusia and the Community of
Valencia. Furthermore, eight of the fifteen analysed communities
(53.3%), two more than in 2007, have scheduled courses, workshops etc.
related to multicultural library services for the staff working in
public libraries of the network. This is the case of Andalusia,
Cantabria, Castile&mdash;La Mancha, Castile and Le&oacute;n, the Community of
Valencia, the Community of Madrid, the Community of Murcia, and the
Basque Country.</p> 


<h2>Development of multicultural resource collections</h2>

<p>Related to the measures provided for the gathering of multicultural
knowledge resource collections, we find that eight communities (53.3%)
have developed corresponding initiatives, two more than in 2007. The
communities recently active in this field are the same two
(Aragon and the Basque Country), that have shown a certain activity
regarding other scheduled multicultural services over these past three
years. As shown in Figure 3, the type of  measures provided varies from
region to region. Among the most seconded measures we can find the
provision of the public libraries in the network with requested
information, the advice on the development of multicultural collections
and the operation of centralised multicultural collections.</p>


<figure class="centre"><img alt="Development of Multicultural Resource Collections" src="p554fig3.png"><br>
<strong>Figure 3: Development of multicultural resource collections</strong></figure>


<h3>Planning of Intercultural Services and Activities</h3>

<p>The analysis of the data collected in 2010 shows the following results regarding with the programming of intercultural services and activities in Spanish public libraries: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Seven communities (46.7%) (Andalusia, Castile&mdash;La Mancha, Castile
and Le&oacute;n, Catalonia, the Community of Madrid, the Community of
Murcia, and the Basque Country), five more than in 2007, have
implemented (or are in process of implementating) several planning
campaigns to promote the public library network and its services
among immigrant groups. </li>
  <li>In seven communities (46.7%) (Andalusia, Castile and Le&oacute;n,
Catalonia, the Community of Valencia, the Community of Madrid, the
Community of Murcia and the Basque Country), the information about
services and activities of public libraries is available in
different languages. We should emphasize that this has been one of
the most developed actions over the past three years, since in 2007
only two communities had been campaigning in this way. </li>
  <li>Only four communities (26, 7%) (Andalusia, the Community of
Valencia, the Community of Madrid, and the Community of Murcia),
still two more than in 2007, have planned a system for indicating
specific multicultural library services. </li>
  <li>The loan of multicultural materials is a service currently offered
by the public libraries in six communities (40%)
(Andalusia, Catalonia, the Community of Valencia, the Community of
Madrid, the Community of Murcia, and the Basque Country), which
amounts to two more than in 2007. This kind of service is intended
to be offered as a future service in three more  (20%) (Cantabria, Castile&mdash;La Mancha and Castile and
Leon) (figure 4).</li>
</ul>

<figure class="centre"><img alt="Interlibrary Loan" src="p554fig4.png"><br><strong>Figure 4: Interlibrary loan</strong></figure>
  
<ul>
  <li>Information about the host community is currently not a service
widely offered by the public libraries of the Autonomous
Communities. Only four of them (26.7%) (Andalusia, the Community of
Valencia, the Community of Madrid and the Community of Murcia), have
shown to deliver this kind of service, while only two more of the
Autonomous Communities plan to provide it in the future (13.3%)
(Castile and Le&oacute;n and Catalonia) (figure 5). Meanwhile, the presence
of Websites with electronic resources with particular interest to
immigrant groups in their respective native languages, have only
been developed in four Autonomous Communities (Andalusia, the
Community of Madrid, the Community of Murcia, and the Basque
Country), representing a low percentage of the total (26.7%).
However, three communities (20%) intend to develop this kind of
service in the future. Comparing with the previous survey data from
2007, the strongest evolution among all aspects is represented by
two newly active communities (the Community of Murcia and the Basque
Country) who have developed a website for these groups over the past
three years.</li>
</ul>

<figure class="centre"><img alt="Information about the hosting Community and the access-portal for digitized knowledge resources" src="p554fig5.png"><br>
<strong>Figure 5: Information about the hosting community and the access-portal for digitised information resources</strong></figure>


  <ul>
<li>Learning materials for the host country's language (in
  several Spanish regions, there are two official
  languages) and user training services are the most
  frequently provided services regarding with immigrant
  literacy and training. Other services are still being
  offered in a minor form, although the ratios in
  all cases exceed those achieved in 2007. For example, the
  language courses are being taught in public libraries in
  four communities (three more than in 2007) and
  training courses for social and professional integration of immigrants into our society,
  not offered at all in 2007, are currently available in
  four of them (Figure 6).</li>
  </ul>
  
<figure class="centre"><img alt="Multicultural Training and Literacy" src="p554fig6.png"><br>
<strong>Figure 6: Multicultural training and literacy</strong></figure>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Likewise, in relation to the activities intended to bridge the digital
  divide that immigrant groups face, such as Internet access
  and information literacy,  training courses have
  increased significantly compared with 2007. Currently, there are eight communities
  (53.3%), four more than in 2007, offering free Internet
  access to immigrants in their library facilities, while
  six of these (40%) provided information literacy courses
  to these groups, three more than in the previous study.
  (Figure 7).</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <figure class="centre"><img alt="Activities intended to bridge the Digital Divide faced by Immigrant Groups"
  src="p554fig7.png"><br><strong>Figure 7:  Activities intended to bridge the digital divide faced by immigrant groups</strong>
  </figure>

  <ul>
<li>Except some activities, mainly story-telling or reading
  encouragement, other activities for the promotion of
  intercultural understanding are not being programmed in a
  major way, as they are being realised in public libraries
  in only 33.3% of all autonomous communities (Figure
  8). </li>
  </ul>
  
  <figure class="centre"><img alt="Activities for the Promotion of Intercultural Understanding" src="p554fig8.png"><br>
  <strong>Figure 8: Activities for the promotion of intercultural understanding</strong></figure>
  
  
  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  
   <p>Although Spain has become a slightly bigger multicultural
society during the analysed period, characterised by the
population's steady increase in the percentage of foreign
citizens, the planning of multicultural library services
remains to date without being addressed on a widespread
basis. Less than the half of the libraries (the 40%)
have yet to carry out any kind of initiative for the
development of any multicultural services (this is the case
of Asturias, Cantabria, Extremadura, Galicia, La Rioja and
Navarre). Additionally, there is still a large number of
communities (46.7%) that have not provided any funding for
the development of multicultural services (this is the case
of Asturias, Cantabria, the Community of Valencia,
Extremadura, Galicia, La Rioja and Navarre). It should be
emphasized, in the same way, that only Catalonia, the
Community of Madrid and the Community of Murcia have
incorporated to their libraries workers of foreign origin,
which represents 20% of the communities analysed in this study.</p> 

<p>On the positive side, the multicultural library services
with a strongest increase in between 2007 and 2010 are the
campaigns to promote public libraries and their services
among immigrant groups; the development of actions to bridge
the digital divide; and the programming of activities such
as story-telling and the promotion of activities that
encourage reading among individuals of these groups.
Finally, we conclude that the status of development of these
services shows the same mixed trend in the two study
periods: 2007 and 2010. </p>
