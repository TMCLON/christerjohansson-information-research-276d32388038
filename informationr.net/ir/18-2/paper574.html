<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This study develops a typology of the types of product information given on an e-commerce website.  Such a typology is a prerequisite for investigating and comparing the effects of various types of product information on online consumer decision-making. </p>

<p>Online product information provided by dot-com storefronts plays a central role in informing the consumer of the product value and strengthening the consumer's confidence in making the right purchase (<a href="paper574.html#jeo01">Jeong and Lambert 2001</a>). Since they cannot physically inspect a product as they could in brick-and-mortar stores, online shoppers base their decisions mostly on information they receive on the Internet. In the virtualized shopping environment, they feel more risk (<a href="paper574.html#ant06">Antony <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>) and become highly responsive to the online product information they are getting.</p>

<p>Effective provisioning and organization of online product information becomes increasingly critical for the profitability and survival of Internet retailers and manufacturers (<a href="paper574.html#lee04">Lee and Lee 2004</a>). As dot-com storefronts provide an increasing amount of product information to attract Internet shoppers, <em>information overload</em> has become a pressing issue for online shopping. Information overload occurs as the amount of provided information exceeds individuals' information processing capability (<a href="paper574.html#jac84">Jacoby 1984</a>). Just as information inadequacy, too much information also leads to declines in the quality of decision-making performance (<a href="paper574.html#all05">Allen and Shoard 2005</a>). The phenomenon of information overload has caught a great deal of attention from marketers and marketing researchers since the 1970s. A series of works thoroughly demonstrated that information overload not only decreases the accuracy of consumer decisions, but also leads to less satisfaction and reduced confidence in the decision-making process
(<a href="paper574.html#che09">Chen <em>et al.</em> 2009</a>;  <a href="paper574.html#jac74">Jacoby <em>et al.</em> 1974</a>;  <a href="paper574.html#all05">Allen and Shoard 2005</a>;  <a href="paper574.html#yan98">Yang <em>et al.</em> 1998</a>;  <a href="paper574.html#kel87">Keller and Staelin 1987</a>;  <a href="paper574.html#lee04">Lee and Lee 2004</a>;  <a href="paper574.html#lur04">Lurie 2004</a>;  <a href="paper574.html#mae99">Maes <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>;
 <a href="paper574.html#mal82">Malhotra 1982</a>,  <a href="paper574.html#mal84">1984</a>). With the increasing popularization of small-screen mobile e-commerce, information overload poses an even more serious challenge for practitioners and researchers.</p>
 
 <p>E-commerce information research to date has focused primarily on <em>information quality</em>
and <em>information display</em>, but lacks studies on content-based <em>information types</em>.
The types of product-relevant information and their mechanisms for affecting consumer decisions
are not well understood. The existing information-type research seems limited to only one information type,
<em>customer review</em>. Regarding many other types of product information such as product comparisons, return policy, 
manufacturing details, retailer reputation, use scope, side effects and so on,
research is largely absent or only scratching the surface. There is not yet research that
systematically investigates and compares the functional roles played by different types of
product information and hardly any in-depth knowledge is currently available on their impact
on <em>consumer trust</em>, <em>perceived value</em>, <em>perceived risk</em>, and
<em>purchase intention</em> in the e-retailing context.</p>

<p>Our project aims to bridge this gap by systematically analysing online product
information types and their differential effects on Internet consumer decision making.
To carry out an in-depth investigation and comparison, first we need a scheme to
systematically categorize different information <em>types</em> from amass of online product
information, preferably by different <em>functional roles</em> they play in consumer perception
and decision making. This paper reports on a pilot study of applying a typology of function-based topical
relevance relationships  (<a href="paper574.html#hua09">Huang 2009a</a>, <a href="paper574.html#hua09-2">2009b</a>,
<a href="paper574.html#hua13">2013</a>; <a href="paper574.html#hua04">Huang and Soergel 2004</a>, to analyse online product information types.
</p>


<h2>Literature review</h2>

<h3>A generic typology of topical relevance relationships</h3>

<p><em>Topical relevance</em> is the fundamental concept of information organization
and information retrieval (<a href="paper574.html#coo71">Cooper 1971</a>; <a href="paper574.html#gre95">Green 1995</a>;
<a href="paper574.html#gre95-2">Green and Bean 1995</a>; <a href="paper574.html#hjo10">Hj&oslash;rland 2010</a>;
<a href="paper574.html#hua04">Huang and Soergel 2004</a>; <a href="paper574.html#wil73">Wilson 1973</a>).
Topical relevance is the logical connection between <em>topic</em> and <em>information</em>,
between <em>topic</em> and <em>topic</em>, and between <em>information</em> and
<em>information</em>. It provides the cognitive foundation for human thinking,
reasoning, communication, and decision making. Without recognizing and understanding
the relevance connection between an input (or a stimulus) and its context, we could
hardly make it through simple daily conversations in which inferential communicative
intentions are often embedded, nor could we come to any meaningful judgment or
conclusion about a given situation (<a href="paper574.html#wil02">Wilson and Sperber 2002</a>).
Therefore, topical relevance with its close linkage to thinking and reasoning
is central to many disciplines.</p>

<p>Huang (<a href="paper574.html#hua09">2009a</a>, <a href="paper574.html#hua09-2">2009b</a>, <a href="paper574.html#hua13">2013</a>)
conducted a multidisciplinary inquiry into topicality by analysing theories
and thinking from communication, rhetoric, cognitive psychology, education,
information science, argumentation, logic, law, medicine, and history. As the
major outcome, the inquiry constructed a theory-grounded and empirically-verified
typology of topical relevance relationships, providing a conceptual basis for a
generic, function-based, topic-oriented information framework (Figure1) that is
meaningful across topics, domains, and data forms. In particular, the framework is
based on <em>functional role</em>, that is, the role a piece of information plays in the
overall structure of a topic, by taking into account its relations with other parts
of the given information. It adopts the perspective of <em>rhetorical structure theory</em> 
in discourse analysis (<a href="paper574.html#man88">Mann and Thompson 1988</a>,
<a href="paper574.html#tab06">Taboada and Mann 2006</a>): '<em>for every part of
a coherent text, there is some function for its presence, evident to readers</em>' (<a href="paper574.html#tab06">Taboada and Mann 2006</a>: 425).
The emphasis of the functional classification is on the <em>cognitive effect</em> achieved on
the receiver, such as a reader, a hearer, an information user, a consumer, etc.
The  <em>cognitive effect</em> refers to a substantial change of the receiver's knowledge state or
viewpoint after receiving a piece of relevant information, which can confirm, reinforce,
revise, or disprove the receiver's original beliefs. As applying to e-commerce, each kind
of product information relates to the product in a different topical way and plays a
specific role in enhancing the consumer's perception of a product's value as well as
associated risks, and strengthening or adjusting his/her buying intention.
For example, <em>product feature description</em> and <em>return policy</em> relate to a product in
two very different ways and each plays a different functional role in influencing the
consumer's purchase decision: feature description directly improves the consumer's
understanding of the product's value while return policy contributes to reducing his/her
anxiety of making the buying decision. Essentially, the function-based relevance typology
provides a relationship framework for specifying the functional role of each type of
product-relevant information and differentiating their cognitive effects on the consumer.
The functional classification directly ties with the consumer's knowledge state and cognitive
process underlying online decision making. </p>

<p>The function-based classification has been successfully applied to analyse
three heterogeneous datasets in oral history, clinical question answering, and
art image tagging (<a href="paper574.html#hua09">Huang 2009a</a>, <a href="paper574.html#hua13">2013</a>; <a href="paper574.html#hua04">Huang and Soergel 2004</a>, <a href="paper574.html#hua06">2006</a>
). Moreover, Huang and White (<a href="paper574.html#hua05">2005</a>) developed <em>policy-capturing models</em> (regression-based) to explore individual
effects of different relevant information on the user's relevance judgment;
in these models, highly consistent results were found regarding the relative
importance of each information type for the user's overall judgment.
Similarly, the current study extends the research to the e-business context
by investigating individual effects of various types of product-relevant
information on the overall purchase decision. The findings from this study
also help to further enrich the generic topical relevance typology.</p>

<h3>Product classification, information type, and online shopping preferences</h3>

<p>
From the perspective of advertising, a number of studies have proved strong
associations between the information type and the consumer's shopping preferences
for product classes (<a href="paper574.html#gir02">Girard <em>et al.</em>  2002</a>, <a href="paper574.html#kor06">Korgaonkar <em>et al.</em>  2006</a>,
<a href="paper574.html#nel70">Nelson 1970</a>, <a href="paper574.html#nel74">1974</a>). However, this line of research never systematically defined various information
types, neither did they systematically investigate and compare their individual effects on consumer decision making.</p>

<p>Nelson's <em>Advertising as information</em> (<a href="paper574.html#nel70">1970</a>)
introduced a product classification which soon gained wide acceptance and has
since provided a fruitful avenue for understanding merchants' information
provision (advertising) in relation to consumers' buying behaviour.
The product classification originally began with two major categories, <em>search product</em>
and <em>experience product</em>. It was later refined and extended
(<a href="paper574.html#dar73">Darby and Karni 1973</a>,
<a href="paper574.html#kle98">Klein 1998</a>,
<a href="paper574.html#nel74">Nelson 1974</a>)
and eventually adapted to analyse Internet retailing
(<a href="paper574.html#gir02">Girard <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>,
<a href="paper574.html#kor10">Korgaonkar <em>et al.</em> 2010</a>,
<a href="paper574.html#kor06">Korgaonkar <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>,
<a href="paper574.html#lal99">Lal and Sarvary 1999</a>).
The product classification as adapted to e-retailing is summarised as follows
(recognizing that in the context of e-retailing these distinctions are fuzzy,
<a href="paper574.html#kor06">Korgaonkar <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Search products</strong>: the consumer can determine the quality of the product
<em>before</em> the purchase by searching information about the product. Examples are
books and laptops.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Experience products</strong>: the consumer cannot (or only with great difficulty
and expense) determine the quality of the product before the purchase; instead s/he needs
to personally <em>experience</em> the product to determine the quality.
Examples are clothing and perfumes.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Credence products</strong>: the consumer has no way of fully evaluating and
determining the quality of the product neither <em>before</em> nor <em>after</em>
the purchase; instead s/he has to base the purchase on credence or trust of the brand.
'<em>This occurs because the consumer may not possess sufficient technical expertise to
assess the product's true performance</em>'
(<a href="paper574.html#for88">Ford <em>et al.</em> 1988</a>: 240)
and the effects of these products are often not directly perceivable.
Examples are water purifier, vitamins, and anti-aging cream.
</li>
</ul>


<p>Research found significant differences between search, experience, and credence
products with respect to the types of information consumers prefer in advertising.
<em>Direct information</em> is preferred for shopping search products and <em>indirect information</em> (such as brand reputability and endorsements) is preferred for shopping experience products (<a href="paper574.html#nel74">Nelson 1974</a>). For e-retailing, products with “digital attributes (which can be communicated on the web
at very low cost)” are more likely to succeed than products associated with '<em>nondigital
attributes (for which physical inspection of the product is necessary)</em>'
(<a href="paper574.html#lal99">Lal and Sarvary 1999</a>: 485).
Digital attributes are mostly corresponding to search products whereas nondigital
attributes are often associated with experience and credence products
(<a href="paper574.html#kor06">Korgaonkar <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>).
From a series of empirical analyses, consumers demonstrate
stronger preference for shopping search products rather than experience and credence
products on the web (
<a href="paper574.html#gir02">Girard <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>,
<a href="paper574.html#kor10">Korgaonkar <em>et al.</em> 2010</a>,
<a href="paper574.html#kor06">Korgaonkar <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>).
This preference can be attributed to online information provisioning: the provided
standard direct product information is usually sufficient for consumers to make informed
decisions about purchasing search products, yet it is inadequate for consumers to
judge experience and credence products. Instead, when evaluating experience and credence
products, consumers tend to draw on indirect, contextual, and evaluative information,
such as the retailer's reputability information, third-party evaluation, product comparison
guides, and customer reviews.

</p><p>
Given its strong influence on consumers' information preferences, our study considers
<em>product type</em> as a significant factor to moderate the decision effects of information type.
It guides us to collect online product cases for the following analysis and provides a
conceptual basis for identifying useful strategies for organizing online product-related
information.
</p>

<h2>Research questions</h2>

<p>
This pilot study intends to answer the following two research questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
What are the manifestations of the function-based topical relevance typology in
the e-retailing context? Which relevance categories are applicable and which are not?
</li>
<li>
What information types are present in online product pages? And what information types
are absent? Do these vary with the type of product? 
</li>
</ol>



<h2>Method</h2>

<p>
This is an exploratory study with sixteen product cases were collected from Amazon, including five search products, six experience products (three electronics and three traditional goods), and five credence products.. We used qualitative content analysis and pattern matching
to conduct in-depth analyses of the information types present from the samples.
Many studies using qualitative content analysis to look for themes (<a href="paper574.html#tro05">Trochim and Kane 2005</a>),
patterns (<a href="paper574.html#tho96">Thompson 1996</a>), or the largely <em>rhetorical structure</em> of texts
(<a href="paper574.html#kis97">Kiser 1997</a>). This study uses qualitative content analysis to specify the function-based topical
connections between the product of interest and the product information provided.</p>

<p>To improve methodological precision and rigour we used <em>template analysis</em> and <em>editing analysis</em> 
(<a href="paper574.html#mar02">Marsh 2002</a>; <a href="paper574.html#mil92">Miller and Crabtree 1992</a>)
to guide the analysis.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<em>Template analysis</em> is a semi-structured coding process that uses
<em>templates</em> and <em>code books</em> developed before data analysis.
The template can be thought of as a coding scheme or an analysis guide; it can be developed based on a variety of preconceptions, such as '<em>theory, research tradition, pre-existing knowledge, and/or a summary reading of text</em>' (<a href="paper574.html#mil92">Miller and Crabtree 1992</a>: 19). 
We used the initial generic typology as a guiding template to analyse how
the broader topical relevance categories apply to analysing Amazon product pages.
Interaction of the data and the template (scheme) introduced continuous revisions
to the template and involved several iterations until no new revisions were identified
(reaching the point of saturation, <a href="paper574.html#lin02">Lindlof and Taylor 2002</a>).
</li>
<li>
<em>Editing analysis</em> mirrors the <em>open coding</em> phase in inductive analysis
(<a href="paper574.html#lin02">Lindlof and Taylor 2002</a>, <a href="paper574.html#mar02">Marsh 2002</a>),
whereby the inquirer approaches the data with minimal preconceptions and proceeds
to develop conceptual categories through an inductive process (<a href="paper574.html#str90">Strauss and Corbin 1990</a>).
We used it for analysing finer levels of topical relationships to further extend the hierarchy and thus developed the fine-grained structure under each broad
relevance category inductively from the data.
</li>
</ol>


<h2>Results and discussions</h2>

<p>
The findings confirm that the overall topical relevance framework
with the broad relevance categories remain meaningful and stable as adapted
to the e-commerce domain. <em>Direct</em>, <em>context/condition</em>, <em>comparison</em>,
and <em>evaluation</em>
are the prevalent information types identified from the Amazon case analysis.
Table 1 summarizes all the relevant information types and subtypes identified
from the analysis. Although the broad relevance categories remain similar, many
domain-specific subcategories are suggested from the study. Taking the <em>context</em>
category as an example, <em>purchase (selection)-related</em> and <em>use-related</em> context are
completely new subcategories without direct mapping to the original typology.
They are specific to analysing e-commerce cases and quite important for online
consumer decision making.

<p>
In the following, each of the five product-relevant information types is discussed in more detail and illustrated with exemplar cases.
</p>

<h3>Direct information (matching topic)</h3>

<p>Matching-topic or direct information in the e-retailing context refers to information
that directly describes the characteristics, specifications, functions, and features of
the product. It also includes manifestations, samples, and illustrations of the product
as shown in the following table. As implemented on <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, the consumer could listen
to a part of an mp3 song online,  <em>look inside</em> a book by a click, and read its excerpts
and key phrase extractions. Illustration is considered direct information as well,
such as sample pictures taken by a digital camera the consumer is considering, or how a
sofa set of interest fits in a home setting.</p>

<p>Direct information answers the questions of <em>what the product is</em> and <em>what it can do</em>.
It provides the most relevant and immediate information for the consumer to make
judgments of the value and suitability of the product. As expected, direct product
information is prevalent and placed at the centre of focus for all the collected cases.
Table 2 summarizes specific direct information types with associated case samples.

<h3>Context information</h3>
<p>
Context information does not directly address the specifications, features, functions,
and performance of the product; instead context supplies information about 
<em>its making</em>, <em>its purchase</em>, <em>its use</em>, and
<em>its relations with other products</em>. It may not lead to direct judgments about the product's value; however, context
information helps to address consumers' additional concerns, set their thinking
within a broader and richer background, and thus better inform their decisions.
Compared to direct information, context is secondary information and its presence
and richness are more subject to individual products. For example, the collected
traditional experience goods (shoes, jeans, and sofa set) in this study seem to
have little context information. 
</p>
<p>
As compared to other information types, context is most interesting and much diversified; it is very inclusive and contains a large variety of manifestations. In the following, different types of context information are exemplified. 
</p>



<ol>
<li>
<em>Provenance-related context</em>: answers the questions of <em>who made the product</em>,
<em>where and how it was made</em>, as well as <em>when it was made available</em>.
These types of information can be used to imply the quality of a product and to
strengthen the consumer's confidence in the product. (See examples in Table 3).<br /><br />

against their own using habits or constraints. For example, for clothing the
maintenance work of '<em>Machine wash</em>' vs. '<em>Dry clean</em>' may make a difference in the
consumer's choice. (See examples in Table 5).<br /><br />

<em>Relations with other products</em>: Situates the current product within a network of products
(such as broader category) and makes recommendations. The primary purpose here is to increase
the consumer's awareness of a broader product network, so as to induce more interests and
expand sales. The category of “Bought together” is a typical Amazon feature based on consumer
data mining, which in turn encompasses many kinds: “Frequently bought together”, “Customers
who bought this item also bought”, “What other items do customer buy after viewing this item?”,
 “Consumers also bought this items by”, and so on. Apparently there are overlapping results
among different “Bought together” algorithms. As observed, these algorithms not only bring
up similar products
(e.g.,<img alt="frequently bought together" src="p574fig14.gif" width="180" height="70" /> ),
but also brings up products likely used together
(e.g.,<img alt="frequently bought together" src="p574fig15.gif" width="180" height="70" /> ).
Rather than being measured directly as in <em>similarity-based comparison</em>
discussed later, the achieved similarities here is simply the by-product (instead of the aim)
of customer data analytics. This puts them into the user-based context category rather
than the similarity-based comparison category. (See examples in Table 6).

<h3>Condition information</h3>
<p>
Following the generic typology, the information about compatibility and system requirements
falls into the category of <em>Condition–Helping or hindering factor (condition)</em>.
Similar to context information discussed above, it also assists the customer in making better
informed decisions. In the original topical relevance typology, the category of <em>Condition</em>
was included in <em>Context</em> but was later separated out to emphasize its higher degree
of specificity (such as in clinical analysis). However, in the current e-retailing context,
it is arguable whether there is enough justification to differentiate <em>Condition</em> from
<em>Context</em>. The collected cases in this pilot study supply very limited instances and
more data are required for us to draw the final conclusion. Speaking solely for the following
two condition information types, they may well fit into the category of use-related context.
(See examples in Table 7).</p>

<h3>Comparison information</h3>
<p>
This category emphasizes the element of comparison and provides similarity-based options.
Just as <em>Relations with other products</em> (context), its purpose is also to deliberately
broaden consumers' horizon of products and enhance their awareness and interests of related products.
However, it is important to note that these similarities are measured based on the <em>intrinsic</em>
properties of the products, rather than the external, contextual associations created by
consumer browsing and buying activities, and therefore different from the “Brought together”
category. Amazon.com uses various types of algorithms to detect and calculate similarities
between products, such as “by category”, “by subject (topic)”, “by the same author”, and so on.
(See examples in Table 8).

<h3>Evaluation information</h3>
<p>A great number of studies have confirmed that consumers are highly dependent on
user evaluations (reviews) on the web, even though they might not always follow these
reviewers' opinions and suggestions (<a href="paper574.html#sen07">Sen and Lerman 2007</a>,
<a href="paper574.html#sen04">Senecal and Nantel 2004</a>).
Moreover, positive reviews seem to have a stronger influence on the consumer
than negative reviews do
(<a href="paper574.html#ver09">Vermeulen and Seegers 2009</a>).
Coming from a source of
neutrality and user perspective, customer evaluation is regarded more reliable,
unbiased, and informative compared to the information supplied directly by the seller.
The reviews on Amazon.com are highly detailed and organized, covering many aspects of
the product. It will be interesting to further investigate whether different types
of evaluation information affect consumer decision making differently, for instance,
does the source of evaluation make a difference, i.e., customer reviews vs. expert reviews?
How much attention would consumers place to formal evaluation (such as double-blind clinical study)
as compared to informal evaluation? What about ranking information?
(See examples in Table 9).</p>

<p>
Note: For simplicity, we have placed customer reviews and expert reviews under
<em>Evaluation</em> because they are most important for the evaluative information
they contain.  However, reviews may also include many types of information other than
evaluation, such as tips on how to use a product.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<!--================================================-->
<p>
Making online purchase decisions is a process combining quality/price evaluation
and relevance judgment. Consumers need to find out not only the quality but also the
relevance of the product to their personalized needs and requirements. Applying the
function-based topical relevance typology to analyse online product-relevant information
provides a basis for us to further discuss how different types of information contribute
to this evaluation and judgment process.
</p>
<p>
Through this study, <em>direct (matching topic)</em>, <em>context</em> (including
<em>condition</em>), <em>evaluation</em>, and <em>comparison</em> are identified as
the four most applicable and prevalent information types from Amazon product pages.
The more argument-linked and reasoning-centred information types such as <em>evidence</em>
and <em>cause/effect</em>, and <em>purpose/motivation</em> are not noticeably significant from
the analysis. However, this may be due to the small sample gathered from a single source
(<a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>). As guided by this pilot study, more cases will be collected from different
sites in US as well as in China to allow more systematic comparison between product types
in relation to cultural contexts.</p>

<p>
The focus or role of each information type is summarised in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Direct (matching topic)</strong>: answer the questions of what the product is
and what it can do;
</li>
<li>
<strong>Context</strong>: supply additional information related to its making, it
 purchase and selection, its use, and its position in the product network;
</li>
<li>
<strong>Comparison</strong>: identify similarity-based products and options;
here similarity is broadly defined and has many meanings, such as, common feature,
shared use context, same brand/manufacturer, etc.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Evaluation</strong>: answer the question of how well it performs.

</li>
</ul>

<p>
The in-depth analysis also extends and enriches the original function-based
typology by introducing new sub-categories. Another finding is that a lot of site
features and provided information serve the same purpose of introducing other
related products. In many cases, these features and information occupy over 50% of
the entire product page. The intention is clear but what are the effects on consumers'
buying is yet to be discovered. Instead, with the potential risk of information overload,
does the extra information further distract the consumer from making focused comparison
and decision?</p>

<p>
The presence and richness of individual information types seem to vary largely with
the type of product, for instance, electronics in general have more detailed accounts
than clothing, shoes, and furniture. From our observation, this variance cannot be
directly attributed to the search-experience-credence differences; instead, whether
or not the critical features of the product can be evaluated digitally seems to play
a more significant role. For example, the critical features of a dress are much more
difficult to be digitized than those of a camera, even though they are both experience
products. As presented at e-storefronts, the distinction between search products and
experience products needs to be revisited and refined. 
</p>
<p>
Our ultimate research goal is to systematically investigate and compare the effects
of various types of product information on the online consumer decision-making process.
We first apply a function-based topical information typology
(<a href="paper574.html#hua09">Huang 2009a</a>, 
<a href="paper574.html#hua13">Huang 2013</a>)
to guide the systematic categorization of online product information and thus enable
a focused comparison between different information types. The findings will provide
a basis for prioritized information provisioning and organization which helps to
remedy the pressing issue of information overload in e-retailing especially with
small-screen mobile devices. Since the information type preferred for making online
buying decisions varies significantly with the product type, retailers need to
customize their information strategy to different types of products
(<a href="paper574.html#gir02">Girard <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>).
For example, on the one hand, Internet retailers could focus on direct information
for selling search products and be more selective about providing other types of information.
On the other hand, they want to intentionally offer more context, comparison, and
evaluation information to complement standard product description, so as to “motivate
consumers to purchase the difficult-to-sell products online”
(<a href="paper574.html#gir02">Girard <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>: Discussion). 
To combat information overload in e-commerce, simply limiting the absolute amount of
product information is not enough; and it can also be problematic since insufficient
information might in fact compromise consumers' ability to make fully informed decisions.
A more promising strategy will be better designing, prioritizing, organizing, and tailoring product information to assist online shoppers to fully compare and evaluate products of interest and
make well-informed purchases.
