          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          
          <p>This research is the first to investigate the experiences of  teacher-librarians as evidence-based practitioners. The findings of this  research and the associated model (<a href="paper632.html#gil13">Gillespie, 2013</a>) demonstrate that evidence-based practice is holistic. This paper presents the empirically derived model  which emerged from this research. In particular it explains the two distinct  ways that teacher-librarians experience evidence-based practice.  The two overarching actions of engaging and  encountering describe this experience. The paper begins by providing a context  for this research, an overview of the literature explains the research approach  leading to a description of the empirical model. A discussion of the  implications is followed by recommendations for a way forward for teacher-librarians, and the library and information services sector in general. </p>
          
          <p>This study responded to the findings of the <em>Inquiry  into school libraries and teacher-librarians in Australian schools</em> (<a href="paper632.html#hou11">Australia. <em>House...</em>, 2011</a>).  These initiatives have raised awareness of school libraries, and of the role of  teacher-librarians and their impact on student social, cultural and academic  achievement. However, their future sustainability is under scrutiny. </p>
          
          <p>In Australia, there are several hundred professional teacher-librarians with dual teaching and librarianship qualifications across all  school sectors. The Australian School Library Association (<a href="paper632.html#aus09">2009</a>) in its <em>Statement on teacher-librarian  qualifications</em> recommends that:</p>
          
          <blockquote>The person responsible for leading and  managing the school library should be a qualified teacher-librarian. As a  member of a school's teaching team, the teacher-librarian has a role in the  planning, implementation and evaluation of educational policies, curricula,  outcomes and programs, with particular reference to the development of  students' information literacy.</blockquote>
          
          <p>teacher-librarians have a multi-faceted role but central to  the role are the contributions to the learning goals of the school.  teacher-librarians with dual qualifications  are professionally balanced between education and librarianship, and can draw  on both areas of expertise to support teaching and learning in schools. The  Australian School Library Association (<a href="paper632.html#aus12">2012</a>), in its policy document <em>Advocacy:</em> <em>what is a teacher-librarian?,</em> describes teacher-librarians as  having three major roles: as curriculum leaders, information specialists and  information services managers. </p>
          
          <p>The model for evidence-based practice presented in this paper  makes a research contribution to the early development of a theory for evidence-based practice for teacher-librarians. Research is the foundation of evidence-based practice (<a href="paper632.html#boo10b">Booth, 2010b</a>; <a href="paper632.html#tod02">Todd, 2002</a>) yet very little exists that can  support teacher-librarians in being evidence-based practitioners. In presenting  this model, practitioners can gain a deeper understanding of the theoretical aspects  of evidence-based practice before moving onto the many approaches possible for  teacher-librarians to be evidence-based in their practice.  </p>
          
          <h2>Literature review</h2>
          
          <p>To understand the experience of evidence-based  practice in teacher-librarianship, it is necessary to first understand the  origins and development of evidence-based practice in other fields.  This review explains how evidence-based  practice first emerged in medicine, then diversified into healthcare, health  libraries and education, and eventually into teacher-librarianship. It shows  that there is little research that focuses on teacher-librarians as evidence-based practitioners.</p>
          
          <h3>Evidenced based practice - origins and definitions</h3>
          
          <p>It is from medicine that the concept of evidence-based  practice first emerged and the most widely cited definition comes from this  field.  Evidence-based medicine is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making  decisions about the care of individual patients. The practice of evidence-based  medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best  available external clinical evidence from systematic research (<a href="paper632.html#sac96">Sackett, Rosenberg, Muir, Gray, Haynes and Richardson, 1996, p. 71</a>). </p>
          
          <p>Although Sackett <em>et al</em>.'s definition (<a href="paper632.html#sac96">1996</a>) suggests that evidence-based medicine should not entirely rely on randomised controlled  trials, in practice, evidence-based medicine places evidence in a hierarchy,  with scientific, randomised controlled trials held in the highest regard. As  the practice of evidence-based medicine has gained acceptance, it has been  commonly assumed that evidence-based practice has a basis in research evidence,  particularly that in the quantitative tradition (<a href="paper632.html#ryc04">Rycroft-Malone <em>et al</em>., 2004</a>).</p>
          
          <p>Traditionally, evidence-based medicine has focused on decision making, with an intention to use research to empower staff for best  patient advantage (<a href="paper632.html#mcc06">McCormack, 2006</a>). When applied to nursing and healthcare,  however, there has been a change in focus, where evidence is '<em>contextually located and embedded in  multiple cultures</em>' (<a href="paper632.html#mcc06">McCormack, 2006, p. 90</a>). Hence, within the nursing and  healthcare sectors there is an emphasis on implementation and practice, taking  into consideration the context and environment where practical understandings  can inform and guide practical judgement (<a href="paper632.html#mcc06">McCormack, 2006</a>). </p>
          
          <p>Health libraries first introduced evidence-based practice to  the library and information science field. Definitions of evidence-based  practice in the health library context have been provided by Booth and Brice  (<a href="paper632.html#boo04">2004</a>), Crumley and Koufogiannakis (<a href="paper632.html#cru02">2002</a>), and Eldredge (<a href="paper632.html#eld00">2000</a>). There are many  similarities between these definitions and those that originate from evidence-based medicine.  For example, this definition  from  defines evidence-based practice  in librarianship has been defined as:</p>
          
          <blockquote>a means to improve the profession of librarianship by asking questions as  well as finding, critically appraising and incorporating research from library  science (and other disciplines) into daily practice. It also involves  encouraging librarians to conduct high quality qualitative and quantitative  research (<a href="paper632.html#cru02">Crumley and Koufogiannakis</a>, 2002, p. 62)</blockquote>
          
          <p>There is recognition in this definition that evidence can come from qualitative and quantitative sources, as shown by the models and  conceptual frameworks for implementing evidence-based practice for library and  information services that have been developed by Booth (<a href="paper632.html#boo07">2007</a>), Booth  and  Brice (<a href="paper632.html#boo04">2004</a>), Eldredge (<a href="paper632.html#eld00">2000</a>) and Watson-Boone (<a href="paper632.html#wat00">2000</a>). The definitions of  evidence-based practice in librarianship may appear to be clear cut,  but at this time <em>'no definition of EBLIP  has been proved, nor is there any discussion on how this term relates to or  differs from its predecessors</em>' (<a href="paper632.html#tho08">Thorpe, Partridge and Edwards, 2008, p. 3</a>).</p>
          
          <p>The definition of evidence-based practice in education is  less clear. Here, according to Davies (<a href="paper632.html#dav99">1999</a>) it operates at two levels. The  first, similar to the nursing and health care, and library and information  sectors, is to use existing evidence from research and literature  on education and related subjects. The second is to establish sound evidence  where existing evidence is lacking; that is to take a problem-solving,  self-directed approach (<a href="paper632.html#dav99">Davies, 1999</a>). In education, there are signals of a  growing acceptance for a multi-faceted approach to evidence-based practice, '<em>which not only examines the issues related  to the research process and organisational culture but also seeks to understand  the teacher as a professional learner and information user'</em> (<a href="paper632.html#wil04">Williams and Coles,  2004, p. 813</a>). A third level, not recognised by Davies (<a href="paper632.html#dav99">1999</a>), for evidence-based practice in education is for transparent accountability (<a href="paper632.html#dic05">Dickinson, 2005</a>; <a href="paper632.html#ham01">Hammersley, 2001</a>) where performance indicators measure whether requirements are  being met. </p>
          
          <p>These three levels would seem to be competing forces, but  this is an indication that evidence-based practice in education is taking a  different direction from that as understood in medicine and health care. The  move to use evidence for accountability and performance takes the concept of  evidence-based practice a long way from the Sackett <em>et al</em>. (<a href="paper632.html#sac96">1996</a>), Stetler, Brunell, Giuliano, Morsi, Prince and Newell-Stokes (<a href="paper632.html#ste98">1998</a>), and Crumley and Koufogiannakis (<a href="paper632.html#cru02">2002</a>) basic premises that evidence  (from a variety of sources) informs practice.</p>
          
          <p>Evidence-based practice in teacher-librarianship has been  influenced by the understanding of evidence-based practice in education. This is  unsurprising, given that teacher-librarianship is situated in education.  However, the definition of evidence-based  practice for teacher-librarianship is related more to the purposes for which  evidence is used; its purpose revolves around the key question, '<em>What differences do our school library and its learning initiatives make to student learning?</em>' (<a href="paper632.html#tod02">Todd, 2002, p. 2</a>).  Within teacher-librarianship, Todd suggests that:</p>
          
          <blockquote>evidence-based practice focuses on the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in  making decisions about the performance of the day by day role. It is about  using research evidence, coupled with professional expertise and reasoning, to  implement learning interventions that are effective (<a href="paper632.html#tod02">Todd, 2002</a>, p. 2).</blockquote>
          
          <p>A more recent statement from Todd  suggests that evidence-based practice in school librarianship is about:</p>
          
          <blockquote>professional practice being informed  and guided by best available evidence that works, coupled with a focus on  evidence of outcomes and impacts of services in relation to the goals of the  educational environment in which it is situated. (<a href="paper632.html#tod09">Todd, 2009</a>, p. 88)</blockquote>
          
          <p>These definitions have some relationship to the previous  definitions in this review, where the basic premise is that evidence informs  practice. As the primary function of schools is student learning, it is logical  that Todd's definitions link the purpose of evidence-based practice for teacher-librarians to student learning. Providing tangible links between teacher-librarian intervention and student learning could be a strong basis to support  school library facilities, staffing of professionals and support personnel, and  budgets for resources and support services. However, teacher-librarians have  multi-faceted roles and definitions of evidence-based practice for teacher-librarians should also consider the professional contributions that teacher-librarians make to the social and cultural aspects of school life as teachers  and information specialists. Todd's (<a href="paper632.html#tod09">2009</a>) definition, for example, seeks to  include these aspects. Evidence that encompasses these broader aspects of a  teacher-librarian's role could demonstrate the contributions that teacher-librarians make to these aspects of the school. However, at present,  evidence-based practice in teacher-librarianship appears to have three aspects:  research evidence, locally derived evidence and accountability. While the first  two are moderated by professional expertise, the third is systemic, that is  required or imposed by employing bodies. </p>
          
          <p>Todd's (<a href="paper632.html#tod09">2009</a>) discussion paper posits that there are six  common beliefs about evidence-based practice in school librarianship, as  follows. First, school libraries are essential for addressing curriculum  standards. Second, teacher-librarianship is an applied science and profession,  which derives its practice from a diverse body of theoretical and empirical  knowledge. Thus, teacher-librarians are well placed to lead and transform  educational practice. Third, school libraries play a transformative role in the  intellectual, social and cultural development of children. Fourth, teacher-librarians enable the transformation of information to knowledge through their  teaching programmes. Fifth, the value of a school library can be measured, in  terms of documented transformations of learning outcomes, and personal and  social growth of the students. Sixth, sustainable development is associated  with accountability for meeting espoused goals. These beliefs (<a href="paper632.html#tod09">Todd, 2009, p.  91</a>) move evidence-based practice for teacher-librarians from a rhetorical  warrant to an evidential warrant for professional practice; from a  persuasive or advocacy framework to a declarative and demonstrable framework; from a  process framework to an outcomes framework; and from a <em>tell me</em> framework to a <em>show  me</em> framework.</p>
          
          <p>Todd's thinking opens the conversation for a new direction  for evidence-based practice in teacher-librarianship. Likewise, there are  implications for education. The six core beliefs identify a <em>purpose</em> for evidence-based practice in  teacher-librarianship that goes beyond accessing, appraising and utilising  research to solve problems and inform practice. There is a basic premise in evidence-based practice generally, that evidence informs practice, but beyond that there  appear to be competing and at times conflicting ideas about what evidence-based  practice is and how it should be used. For teacher-librarians there is a greater  emphasis on accountability to use evidence-based practice to demonstrate impact  on student learning, where the practice is embedded in professional practice.  This was an aspect which required further investigation and leads to the aim of  this research.</p>
          
          <h3>Research about how practitioners understand evidence-based practice</h3>
          
          <p>Research about how practitioners in library and information  services, and teacher-librarianship in particular, understand evidence-based  practice is limited. A study by Partridge, Thorpe, Edwards and Hallam (<a href="paper632.html#par07">2007</a>) identified a need to understand  how library and information services professionals experience and understand  evidence-based practice. <em>'If the LIS  profession is to evolve into one grounded in EBP then we need to take stock of  what the profession currently understands of practitioner's [sic] experiences  of EBP in the context of their professional practice'</em> (<a href="paper632.html#par07">Partridge, Thorpe,  Edwards and Hallam, 2007, p. 10</a>).  Partridge, Edwards and Thorpe (<a href="paper632.html#par10">2010</a>) subsequently conducted a phenomenographic  study with library and information services professionals that involved  semi-structured interviews. </p>
          
          <p>The result was a model to describe the collective experience of evidence-based practice for library and information services professionals as presented in Table 1:</p>

            </tr>
            <tr>

              <td style="vertical-align:top;">I am forced to use evidence-based practice when I am pushed into a corner. </td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
</table>
          
          <p>This research found that the range of  approaches that the practitioners applied to evidence-based practice <em>'do not necessarily resemble the existing  models of EBP inherited from the health and medical domains</em>' (<a href="paper632.html#tho08">Thorpe,  Partridge and Edwards, 2008, p. 11</a>). Moreover, it established that evidence-based practice is an experience, not a process.</p>
          <p>Research using a grounded theory  methodology conducted by Koufogiannakis (<a href="paper632.html#kou13">2013</a>) explored how academic librarians  used evidence in their professional decision making. Traditionally, evidence-based practice has focused on decision making and this research was able to  provide deeper understanding of this. The theoretical concept of <em>convincing</em> was determined as the main  way that academic librarians used evidence. Koufogiannakis (<a href="paper632.html#kou13">2013</a>) gained  insights into how the current evidence-based practice in librarianship model  may need to change as academic librarians used a multitude of evidence sources  and these depended on the situation or context and the decision to be made. </p>
          
          <p>These research studies (<a href="paper632.html#par07">Partridge, <em>et al.</em>, 2007</a>; <a href="paper632.html#par10">Partridge, <em>et al.</em>, 2010</a>; <a href="paper632.html#kou13">Koufogiannakis, 2013</a>) investigated the lived  experiences of library professionals. Hunsucker considers that  understanding the '<em>consequences of the  quality of our practice... through the lived world of their users</em>' (<a href="paper632.html#hun07">2007, p. 28</a>) leads to an expanded and broader view of evidence-based practice (<a href="paper632.html#hun07">2007,  p. 2</a>).  It indicates that evidence-based practice has  evolved and is now very different to that which was first conceived by Sackett <em>et al</em>. (<a href="paper632.html#sac96">1996</a>) and its subsequent  hierarchical and procedural models for implementation. It is notable that Booth (<a href="paper632.html#boo10a">2010a</a>), an original exponent of evidence-based practice, now recommends '<em>ditching the premise'</em> of evidence  hierarchies such as those used in the models developed by Booth (<a href="paper632.html#boo07">2007, p.84</a>)  and Eldredge (<a href="paper632.html#eld06">2006</a>) and now considers that there <em>'is no single authoritative hierarchy of evidence'</em>.  Hjorland (<a href="paper632.html#hjo11">2011</a>), in recognising the links  between evidence-based practice and its one-sided hierarchical approach,  suggests that it may be better instead to speak of <em>research based practice</em>, thus allowing a broader interpretation of the concept. In this way, by suggesting a new terminology, a broader  understanding of evidence may evolve. </p>
          
          <h2>Research design</h2>
          
          <p>This study was designed to address the research question: <em>How do teacher-librarians perceive and use evidence-based practice?</em> The research design was informed by  constructionist philosophy and interpretativist perspective, whereas expanded critical  incident technique governed the methods for data gathering and analysis.  McKenzie  considers that '<em>Constructionism…  sees knowledge as dialogically constructed through discourse and conversation  rather than produced within individual minds'</em> (<a href="paper632.html#mck03">2003</a>, p. 262). Interpretativism focuses on  understanding and meaning making as opposed to explanation. In interpretative research, meaning is disclosed,  discovered and experienced (<a href="paper632.html#him08">Himika, 2008</a>). Meaning is something we make or  construct, not something we find or discover (<a href="paper632.html#smi08">Smith, 2008</a>). </p>
          
          <p>Meaning making is  the primary goal of interpretative research and allows narrative to tell the  story. The researcher is not detached from the inquiry, allowing for  reflexivity on the part of the researcher. </p>
          
          <p>This  research explored the lived experiences of teacher-librarians as evidence-based  practitioners. A lived experience could be described as a personal worldview  where teacher-librarians in this study described incidents in context about  their evidence-based practices. As these incidents were described, teacher-librarians became self-reflective about their actions and circumstances. Their  experiences are the evidence, or the truth for the moment, about the incidents.  Parse (<a href="paper632.html#par08">2008</a>, p. 47) describes '<em>truth for the moment'</em> as giving voice to an individual's personal wisdom. Lived  experiences are not <em>the</em> truth; they  are valuable accounts that expose understandings, reflections, assumptions and  perspectives about events (or incidents) and circumstances (<a href="paper632.html#gee01">Geeland and Tayor, 2001</a>). </p>
          
          <p>Flanagan (<a href="paper632.html#fla54">1954</a>) developed critical incident technique as an approach to identify effective and ineffective behaviour relating to a  particular activity. Critical incident technique encourages participants to  recall critical incidents or significant instances when they were involved in a  particular activity.  The expanded  critical incident approach is a related approach, developed by Hughes (<a href="paper632.html#hug12">2012</a>) which  investigates the real-life experiences of a select group of participants,  through semi-structured interviews and inductive data analysis. The expanded  critical incident approach has five phases of planning, collection,  interpretation, analysis and reflection. </p>
          
          <p>The expanded critical incident approach is well suited to  exploratory research. This is the first time that the expanded critical  incident approach has been used to explore teacher-librarians and evidence-based practice (<a href="paper632.html#gil13">Gillespie, 2013</a>). Other methods allow for semi-structured  interviews, but in using the expanded critical incident approach I could  concentrate the questions upon critical incidents. As a researcher, I began  with the assumption that there was discreet knowledge or experience that each  participant possessed. In drawing out the participants lived experiences of  evidence-based practice they could relate an incident, provide an example of  its use and their response or action following. </p>
          
          <p>For this study, I designated <em>critical incidents</em> to be  instances when a teacher-librarian used evidence in some way to inform and  guide their practice as a teacher-librarian. Critical incidents could be described as memorable and meaningful  events. Examples of critical incidents could be when a teacher-librarian  observes students using resources for study-related purposes; a teacher-librarian reads a scholarly article or report; a teacher-librarian gains formal  and informal feedback provided by the principal, teachers, students or parents.  These events may seem to be part of normal routine. What makes them critical in  terms of this research is that they caused a response from teacher-librarians.  The response may have been a reflection, or a raised awareness that the event  was something to take note of and act upon. I sought to gain further  understanding about <em>how</em> teacher-librarians worked to improve  practice and <em>what</em> types of evidence  they valued or responded to or informed their practice. </p>
          
          <p>The findings, which integrate the participants' reported  actions, thoughts and feelings, create a holistic picture of teacher-librarians' experiences of using evidence in their professional practice.  </p>
          
          <h3>The participants and data gathering</h3>
          
          <p>During 2009 and 2010, fifteen qualified teacher-librarians  currently working in Australian schools were interviewed for this research. The  participants came from primary, secondary and multi-campus schools in major cities and regional areas.  The  recruitment related to convenience and used snowball sampling (<a href="paper632.html#fli06">Flick, 2006</a>;  <a href="paper632.html#pat02">Patton, 2002</a>). In applying the  expanded  critical incident approach, I used a variety of strategies to gather data,  allowing for triangulation of data (<a href="paper632.html#den08">Denzin and Lincoln, 2008</a>; <a href="paper632.html#fli06">Flick, 2006</a>).  Data collection relied on face-to-face interviews conducted, when possible, in the  interviewee's workplace.  Additional  strategies including on-site observations, journaling and the rubric (<a href="paper632.html#hen02">Henri, Hay  and Oberg, 2002</a>) for contextual information, verified the emerging  interpretations of the data (<a href="paper632.html#gil13">Gillespie, 2013</a>). In particular, these approaches  allowed each of the interviewees to tell their own story and enriched the data. </p>
          
          <h3>Data analysis</h3>
          
          <p>The purpose of the analysis was to uncover aspects of teacher-librarians' experiences of evidence-based practice and to identify what they  considered to be evidence. All interviews were exposed to many sessions of  analysis. Similar to the expanded critical incident approach, the analysis  involved two types of data categorisation: binary and thematic. Binary  classification, which is typical of the critical incident technique (<a href="paper632.html#fla54">Flanagan,  1954</a>), was used to identify factual details, for instance, whether the outcome  of the incident was positive or negative. Thematic analysis (<a href="paper632.html#ezz02">Ezzy, 2002</a>;  <a href="paper632.html#sal09">Saldana, 2009</a>) involved categorising the emerging themes. This analysis phase,  which was concerned with data reduction, reminded me of taking a crop of  tomatoes and reducing and reducing the fruit until you are left with tomato  paste. Similarly, the analysis process refines the essence of the data until it  is condensed, thick and rich. The terms and categories of the analysis  framework emerged inductively through gradual sifting and refining of the data. </p>
          
          <p>In responding to the interview questions, the answers from the interviewees provided descriptions of their activities, interpretation, opinion and  feelings all mixed in together. The responses to the interview questions  represented the teacher-librarians' total experience or their experiential  knowledge, termed '<em>thick description</em>' (<a href="paper632.html#gee73">Geertz, 1973</a>). I developed an analysis framework which allowed me to capture  and sort each of these aspects so that I was able to analyse, condense and  finally describe the total experiences of the teacher-librarians as evidence-based practitioners (<a href="paper632.html#gil13">Gillespie, 2013</a>).   </p>
          
          <h3>Limitations</h3>
          
          <p>Research is not without limitations. It could be argued that  confining this research to the perspectives of Australian teacher-librarians  could be a limiting factor. However, it is more common in Australia that professional  teacher-librarians have dual qualifications in education and librarianship.  While the title and educational models for teacher-librarians may differ in  other countries, there is potential that these findings can be utilised outside  Australia and go beyond the profession of teacher-librarianship to further  develop evidence-based practice in education and the library and information  sciences. </p>
          
          <h2>The findings</h2>
          
          <p>The findings from this research present a research based  perspective of the experiences of teacher-librarians as evidence-based  practitioners as a model and <em>critical  findings. </em>This paper focuses on the overarching critical finding and a supporting  critical finding. </p>
          
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Overarching critical finding:</strong> evidence-based practice for teacher-librarians is a holistic experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Supporting critical  finding:</strong> evidence-based practice for teacher-librarians involves both purposefully  engaging with evidence and accidentally encountering evidence.<strong> </strong></li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>The empirical model that underpins the critical findings will  now be described. The model (Figure 1) represents the <em>total experience</em> of evidence-based practice for teacher-librarians.   The model has three layers: the inner  circle contains <em>critical actions</em>,  which represent the core activity of gathering and using evidence; the outer  circle contains <em>diversity</em>, which  represents the human dimensions of the activity; and the surrounding rectangle  represents the <em>environment</em> in which  teacher-librarians operate as evidence-based practitioners. Thus the model  shows that critical actions are at the centre of evidence-based practice. Critical  actions are the ways in which teacher-librarians gather and use evidence. These  actions are of two kinds: <em>engaging</em> and <em>encountering</em>. Engaging involves  purposeful evidence gathering, while encountering involves unintended evidence  gathering. Significantly, as the model shows, engaging and encountering are  like two sides of a coin; they are inextricably linked and either one side or  the other always faces outward.  The  critical actions relate to critical incidents. They represent the ways in which  teacher-librarians <em>act</em> as evidence-based practitioners. The arrows represent the <em>critical characteristics</em> of the nature of teacher-librarians'  actions as evidence-based practitioners. These characteristics are <em>reflective </em>and <em>intuitive</em>. They are associated with both types of critical actions,  and so are shown on either side of the central coin. </p>
          
          <figure class="centre"><img src="p632fig1.jpg" alt="Empirical model" />
          <figcaption>Figure 1: Empirical model: the experience of evidence-based practice for teacher-librarians</figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <p>Diversity and environment are the influencing aspects of  evidence-based practice. Diversity reflects the environment in which teacher-librarians work. Diversity encompasses many aspects of evidence-based practice  for teacher-librarians; including the school communities in which they work,  their role descriptions, their needs and uses for gathering and using evidence;  and in the ways in which they approached gathering and using evidence. </p>
          
          <p>There are several possible alternative terms for environment,  such as, setting, situation and information world (Courtright, 2007).  It could also be described as the context. For  this research I adopted the term <em>environment</em> to describe the workplace, the people and the circumstances in which the  teacher-librarians operate and where the critical incidents occurred.</p>
          
          <p>There is an evident distinction between actions and  approaches. Actions are what teacher-librarians do in carrying out their roles  and are either purposeful (engaging) or unintended (encountering), whereas  approaches represent the how and what of teacher-librarians' evidence gathering  practices. Approaches could include interviewing students, listening to a  speaker at a conference, collecting student borrowing statistics. Approaches  are characterised by diversity and like actions they can involve both engaging  and encountering. The empirical model (Figure 1) is a graphical representation  of the holistic nature of evidence-based practice as expressed in the  overarching critical finding. </p>
          
    <p>The critical actions and critical characteristics of evidence-based practice at the centre of the model do not operate in isolation; they are  intermingled and entwined. Clarifying each of these actions and characteristics  is like teasing out a tangled ball of wool as each one does not stand on its  own; however, for each incident that the participants of this research  described, one action and characteristic is more prominent than the others. I  will now focus attention on two individual aspects that comprise the empirical  model, that of engaging and encountering. The focus of this paper will make the  links between these two actions represented in the model with the overarching  critical finding and the supporting critical finding. </p>
    
          <h3>The critical actions of engaging and encountering</h3>
          
          <p>The findings indicate two overarching actions that describe  how teacher-librarians experience evidence-based practice. These actions are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>engaging:  a deliberate and purposeful activity, and</li>
            <li>encountering:  an unintended or serendipitous activity or event.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Incidents involving both purposeful engagement and accidental  encountering of evidence have been examined in this study, and can be described as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>engaging  having two modes, that of purposeful seeking and purposeful scanning, and</li>
            <li>encountering  also having two modes, that of accidental finding and accidental receiving.</li>
          </ul>
          
       <p>Zooming in on the critical actions that represent the two  sides of the coin, Table 2 demonstrates the relationship of the critical  actions to the whole model. It provides a detailed representation of how  teacher-librarians <em>act</em> as evidence-based practitioners and explains the ways in which teacher-librarians engage  with and encounter evidence.    </p>
       
          <p>In Table 2, the first column identifies the type of critical action,  whether engaging or encountering. The second column shows the two modes for  each of the critical actions. The third column outlines the intention  associated with each critical action. The fourth column, entitled Activity, describes  the nature of the critical action and how teacher-librarians could engage with  or encounter evidence. The fifth column presents examples of real actions  described by teacher-librarians during interviews. The critical actions and  activities are all encompassed by the influencing aspects of diversity  (represented by the inner border) and environment (represented by the outer  border).  </p>

          </table>
          
<p>As the empirical model and this detailed critical actions  table show, for teacher-librarians evidence-based practice is not a series of  steps or procedures to be followed; it is a simultaneous, fluid movement that  can involve encountering evidence, reflection, engaging with evidence and  improving practice. A supporting critical finding emerging from this research  shows that evidence-based practice for teacher-librarians involves both  purposefully engaging with evidence and accidentally encountering evidence. </p>
          
    <p>To begin the description of these aspects, the next section  will provide examples to explain how teacher-librarians engage with and  encounter evidence to highlight the intent and activities of teacher-librarians  as they gather and use evidence. Although I begin with the critical action of  engaging with evidence, these actions are not presented hierarchically, nor is  one favoured over the other. </p>
<h3>The critical action of engaging with evidence</h3>
    
          
          <p>Engaging with evidence has two modes, that of purposeful  seeking and purposeful scanning. <em>Purposeful  seeking</em> is an action where a teacher-librarian is actively seeking contact  with an identified source and is searching for specific evidence; whereas <em>purposeful scanning</em> involves a teacher-librarian identifying a likely evidence source to provide evidence for a  specific purpose. Each will be described below, using direct quotes and  vignettes to illustrate specific incidents that teacher-librarians related in  this research. Each teacher-librarian is identified by a pseudonym to protect  their identity. </p>
          
          <h3>Engaging with evidence - purposeful seeking</h3>
          
          <p> Caitlin <em>purposefully sought</em> evidence when she interviewed one-on-one the senior students to gain their  reactions to the new online databases that had been introduced and the hands-on  training that they had received. She recorded the actual statements of the  students, which she describes as <em>'real  evidence… and it adds a different dimension, you know it is voices that come  in… it just gives you credibility, I think'. </em>The intent of Caitlin's evidence-seeking  was to gain feedback from the students. She had a specific purpose, hence she  was purposefully seeking evidence to evaluate the new online databases which  had been introduced. The activity of this targeted investigation was Caitlin's  asking the students pre-planned questions. She was able to collate their  responses and make adjustments to how the students were introduced to the  databases in the future. The feedback evidence provided information for the  teaching team to evaluate and then re-structure their approach for the students  in the following year.</p>
<h3>Engaging with evidence – purposeful scanning</h3>
    
          <p>The following vignette illustrates how Meg's deliberate  engagement with evidence informed her decision making. Meg engaged with, or  purposefully scanned for evidence when she took a collaborative approach to  evidence gathering in setting up a library staff wiki. Her intention in using  the wiki was for a specific purpose, in that the evidence gained from the wiki  could inform decision-making and demonstrate the library's accountability.  </p>
          <p>Meg supervises a library staff of 22,  so she is very heavily involved in school library management. She is concerned  with the provision of access to information for the students but also for her  own staff. Meg likes to keep the school library at the forefront of technology  and innovation, but everything needs the approval of the school management.  While the school management is generous with the library budget, when moving  for change she first needs to present a convincing case to them. It is here  that evidence is necessary to support her case for any changes – whether these  be in approaches to teaching, staffing or tools for learning. Meg reflects  that: '<em>evidence actually assists you to  go to management and say, as a team, not just me, we think this is a great idea…  we would like to do this because</em>…'</p>
          <p>Meg's  approach had additional benefits. Her collaborative approach to evidence  gathering empowered her staff by actively involving them in the process. Meg  wanted each staff member to have some sort of commitment from a professional  point of view, thinking about how they could make a difference. To this end,  she encouraged the staff to report in a wiki the things that they were doing  differently over the year. The wiki gathered actions, thoughts and fresh ideas  from everyone, even those who may not normally contribute. In this way the  staff who may have felt less empowered could see that they too have made an impact. </p>
          <p>To Meg,  the staff comments in the wiki constitute important evidence. Her collaborative  approach to evidence-based practice has the benefit of building strong team  relationships, by providing an opportunity for new ideas to be shared. By  gathering and documenting evidence in these ways Meg is engaging by purposefully  scanning for evidence. </p>
          <p>Many  participants experienced purposeful seeking and scanning as they engaged with  evidence. Caitlin and Meg have been highlighted as two examples in Table 3. It is now  possible to expand on Table 2 <em>Critical actions  in the empirical model</em> to provide a fuller description of engaging with  evidence. </p>

    </table>
<p>In these examples from Caitlin and Meg, evidence is recorded in some way. These are deliberately planned  activities. Purposeful seeking is the more structured approach with a more  clearly defined purpose of searching for evidence to meet a particular  pre-defined need. Purposeful scanning, also a deliberate activity, is less  structured. Both activities could provide evidence that is unexpected, but in  the less structured approach of purposeful scanning, unexpected evidence is  more likely. This could provide insights and opportunities that were not  anticipated when the activity was first planned. This is not a hierarchical  representation; the activity that has been undertaken by Caitlin or Meg in  these instances has been governed by their evidence needs and the environments  in which they work. </p>
<h3>Implications for teacher-librarians</h3>
    
          <p>As Meg and Caitlin's examples show,  engaging involves teacher-librarians in deliberately planning and seeking  evidence for specific needs identified by them. There is much evidence  available within the local context that teacher-librarians can draw upon, and like  Caitlin and Meg they can put strategies in place to capture the local data.  These strategies involve forward thinking to plan the purpose of the evidence  gathering, recognising the evidence available to them and then devising a process  to easily record it. While the examples provided here from Meg and Caitlin have  involved gathering evidence from the local context, deliberate engagement with  evidence could also involve gaining evidence from external sources, for  example, by purposefully seeking benchmark data to align the school library  collection with national standards, or purposefully scanning for specific  information by attending a session at a conference. These examples indicate  that teacher-librarians can plan and deliberately seek evidence to meet  specific and pre-determined needs and then devise a strategy to capture that  evidence. However, not all evidence seeking by teacher-librarians is a  deliberate pre-planned activity. The opposite side of the critical actions coin,  the critical action of encountering evidence, will now be described. </p>
<h3>The critical action of encountering evidence </h3>
    
          <p>Encountering evidence has two modes, that of <em>accidental finding</em> and <em>accidental receiving.</em> Accidental finding  is a serendipitous encountering of evidence, usually in unexpected places, whereas  accidentally receiving evidence is sourcing evidence from another party.</p>
<h3>Encountering evidence – accidental finding </h3>
    
          <p>The following examples from Caitlin and Donna (Table 4) illustrate ways  of encountering by accidentally or unintentionally finding evidence. The  following vignette describes how Caitlin encounters, or accidentally gains,  evidence affirming that teaching interactions have been successful. </p>
          <p>Caitlin reported being '<em>quite  chuffed</em>' one day when she was working in the library and a Year 8 boy came  up to her after school and said, '<em>You  know that site that you were promoting on the library blog; well it is blocked  at school'</em>. She replied, '<em>Oh OK, that  is really good feedback. I didn&#39;t realise that</em>'. Since she had not promoted  the blog much, she asked the student how he knew about it. He replied, 'Oh I  put an RSS feed on it'. Caitlin thought '<em>Whoo  hoo!</em>' because this was evidence that the students are competent users of  the library blog and it was affirmation that the students were using Web 2.0  tools in a positive way to enhance their learning. This incident also led her  to reflect that in future she should cover more advanced Web 2.0 strategies,  such as using RSS feeds with Year 8 students.  </p>
          <p>Caitlin's  encountering of this evidence is completely unexpected, but very opportune.  Although she had constructed the blog and promoted it with the students, she  had not structured any devices to gather evidence of its effectiveness or use.  The activity described here involves the unsolicited feedback from a student, which  indicated that the student was not only using the blog, but had put mechanisms  in place by way of an RSS feed, so that he could easily retrieve it in the  future. It was also an indication that the skill set of this particular  student, and possibly others in his cohort, was well developed to take the  students further in the future. As a further example, the following vignette indicates  how Donna used evidence she accidentally found, gained by chance from students:</p>
          <p>Donna  comments, '<em>Feedback from the boys is  probably as important as anything to me</em>'. She describes a teaching moment  when a student made a comment, '<em>Now I can  see…</em>' that indicates to her that he had understood a particular point,  leading her to think '<em>Oh my god, he&#39;s got it, he&#39;s nailed exactly what we are doing in here, why we are doing this  research, working through this process</em>'. This is evidence about him  transferring his skills from what he had learnt previously to a new learning  focus and causing him to say '<em>Now I can  see how to do this</em>'.</p>
          <p>Again, this evidence from the student was completely  unexpected but provided an opportunity for Donna to understand how the students  were developing as inquiring learners. This was a serendipitous and  unstructured activity that provided Donna with valuable feedback. </p>
    <p>For Caitlin and Donna, the evidence gained from the students  was unstructured, unexpected and not recorded, yet provided valuable feedback  for Donna on her teaching activities and for Caitlin on the way in which she  was facilitating access to information. In these two examples the feedback  evidence had been positive but it could just as equally have been negative. No  matter what the feedback, the evidence gained from chance encounters is  something that teacher-librarians can use to inform practice and guide future  decision-making.</p>
<h3>Encountering evidence – accidental receiving</h3>
    
          <p>Accidental receiving of evidence is understood as sourcing  evidence from another party. For example, a teacher-librarian is told some  information or feedback, usually during a personal encounter. In this case,  encountering evidence is unexpected and unsolicited and could be described as  coming out of the blue. As illustrated by the following vignette, Caitlin  experienced such an encounter, when she accidentally received evidence during a  conversation with her Head Master.</p>
          <p>Caitlin was actively gathering evidence and documentation for her yearly  teacher appraisal. She sought clarification and began talking the process over  with the Head Master where in conversation he asked her, '<em>How do you think your year has been?</em>' to which Caitlin replied that  it had been a big year and she thought that she had achieved a lot. His reply,  '<em>My word you have</em>', was unexpected  especially as she had not yet submitted her appraisal document. </p>
          <p>With this comment, the Head Master unexpectedly provided  affirming evidence that Caitlin was performing well in her professional role. The  Head Master had already come to some conclusions about how the library had  impacted on teaching and learning at the school and in an encountered  conversation passed his thoughts onto Caitlin. While Caitlin had not sought this  evidence from a third party, it affirmed her activities. </p>
          <p>In light of these highlighted examples it is now possible to  expand on Table 2 <em>Critical actions in the empirical model</em> to provide a fuller description of encountering evidence.</p>

<p>In these examples of encountering evidence, nothing is  recorded initially. It is noted mentally by the teacher-librarians and  remembered as an anecdote. However, this encountered evidence could be recorded  in some way, thus preserving this evidence as a source for evaluation of their  activities. In such encounters, the evidence has not been deliberately sourced  to meet any particular need and may indeed reveal inadequacies and areas that  could be improved, thus providing opportunities and insights that had not been  anticipated.  It was pleasing for both  Caitlin and Donna that their activities produced such positive responses. Again  this is not a hierarchical representation, and the encountered evidence is as a  result of their activities in their workplace environments. </p>

<h3>Implications for teacher-librarians</h3>
    
          <p>As shown by the above  examples, teacher-librarians might experience <em>encountering</em> as an unintentional or serendipitous activity or event.  If alert to evidence, they might receive useful feedback in the form of an  overheard remark or unexpected observation, or an accidental receiving, through  a third party. They might benefit from encountering evidence that is not  pre-planned, nor with a specific pre-defined purpose in mind. Encountered  evidence, as illustrated here, can be sourced in the local environment of their  library or school. It is worth noting that encountered evidence also has the  potential to expose weaknesses that need to be addressed. Mostly, encountered  evidence is not recorded and the teacher-librarian may just remember it as an interesting  anecdote. Other times, encountered evidence strikes a chord, causing the teacher-librarian to think that this is something that could be useful in the future.  This is not systematic and is most likely only to be recorded in some way if  the encountered evidence relates in some way to needs that have already been  identified.  </p>
          <p>Encountered evidence may also be  sourced externally, for example, when attending a workshop where the speaker  provides information causing teacher-librarians to think of new possibilities  for their own situation. This may be recorded in an informal way as notes at  the time of the workshop attendance, should teacher-librarians recognise at the  time that the unexpected information is meeting an identified need. This type  of evidence is more likely to be recalled when the situation arises at a later  time. </p>
    <p>As explained, engagement with and encountering of evidence  are not hierarchical structures; they are also not static. The incidents  described here were chosen to demonstrate one critical action at a time, yet  many of the incidents described by the teacher-librarians demonstrated a  dynamic and fluid relationship between the two critical actions, as the next  section will show. </p>
    
<h3>Working together: encountering and engaging as a fluid approach </h3>
    
          <p>The shorter examples presented so far tend to obscure the  complexity and fluid nature of evidence gathering and use as experienced by  teacher-librarians.  The research  revealed many incidents that demonstrated a seamless, fluid movement from one  action to another as teacher-librarians experience evidence-based practice. The  following vignette of Joan is an example of a teacher-librarian moving from  engaging by actively seeking evidence, then scanning for supporting evidence,  to finally accidentally receiving, from a third party, affirmation that her  practices had been successful. </p>
          
          <p>On Joan's appointment to her school  she wanted to change the way that the teacher-librarian interacts with the  students. The previous teacher-librarian had provided RFF (relief from  face-to-face teaching) and had little contact with teachers to plan and no  opportunity to work with the class teacher as a teaching team. </p>
          
          <p>Joan's current agenda is to improve the quality of teaching. She  approaches her principal and he agrees to a trial of cooperative planning and  teaching with a flexible timetable. In order to gather evidence to support her  case, at the end of the first term Joan engages by purposefully seeking  evidence from the teachers using written surveys where she asks questions such  as, '<em>What were the benefits for the  students? What were the benefits of working professionally in a team? What  improvements could be made? Would they be prepared to do cooperative planning  and teaching in the future?</em>' </p>
          
          <p>With further engagement, Joan purposefully scans for further evidence to  support the evidence she has gathered from the teachers.  She collates a table where she plots the  teachers she has worked with, the classes she has taught, the number of hours  involved. She plots the skills that have been covered against the education  department's information skills outline and the results that the students  achieved. She is able to present this evidence at a staff meeting to gain support  for the co-operative planning and teaching programme (CPT) to be continued.</p>
         
          <p>Joan presents all of the evidence she has gathered to the principal and  she finds that without seeing her evidence, the principal has already formed an  opinion. He says:</p>
          
          <blockquote>Joan, there&#39;s no need for me to even look at that  [and]  If we go back to RFF there will be a staff  mutiny. You&#39;ve converted the library into the hub of the school more quickly  than I ever thought you would. CPT is here to stay.</blockquote>
          
          <p>Joan encountered confirming evidence  when she accidentally received evidence from a third party (her principal) as  affirmation that her introduction and implementation of cooperative planning  and teaching has been successful. </p>
          
          <p>While only one of the critical  actions of engaging or encountering evidence was prominent at any time, as this  vignette demonstrates, Joan moved seamlessly and perhaps without realising it  herself from the actions of purposeful seeking using the written surveys, to  purposeful scanning where she collated and plotted students&#39; skills, to move to  accidentally receiving evidence from her principal.  Joan described this as one incident, yet it  demonstrates a flexible, holistic approach as she completes an evidence picture  that affirms the successful implementation of her cooperative planning and  teaching activities. </p>
          
          <p>From the example provided by Joan, it is now possible to  expand on Table 2 <em>Critical actions in the empirical model </em>to provide a fuller description of the fluid movement  between engaging and encountering evidence.</p>

<h3>Implications for teacher-librarians </h3>

          <p>While engaging and encountering  cannot occur simultaneously, they can however follow each other, with the coin  constantly flipping between one side and the other. This is the fluid approach  that teacher-librarians use when they find evidence using one action, for  instance deliberate engagement, and then being aware of supporting evidence,  perhaps from accidental receiving, as the example from Joan above indicates. </p>
          
          <p>Engaging and encountering are terms I have applied to describe  the critical actions of evidence-based practice for teacher-librarians.  However, in practice, the research suggests that teacher-librarians do not  consciously make the same distinction. The incidents revealed a fluid movement  between the two critical actions as teacher-librarians sought and gathered  evidence to meet predetermined needs where they engaged with evidence or they  serendipitously came upon or encountered evidence. This demonstrates that for  teacher-librarians, evidence-based practice can be guided by professional  knowledge and expertise. There can be a seamless movement from one action to  the other as a teacher-librarian as a practitioner draws on her professional  knowledge and experience, gains affirmation through the evidence received and  then moves to the next activity. The example from Joan illustrates the fluid  nature of evidence-based practice for teacher-librarians, but it also  highlights how a teacher-librarian can draw on her professional knowledge and  experience to initiate a new approach to teaching and learning and then to  gather and use evidence to support her actions. </p>
          <h2>Discussion</h2>
          <p>Engaging with and encountering  evidence are at the heart of evidence-based practice for teacher-librarians. This  is described in the following supporting critical finding. </p>
          <p>evidence-based practice for teacher-librarians involves both purposefully engaging with evidence and accidentally  encountering evidence. </p>
          <p>The critical incidents described in this research indicate a  higher prevalence of approaches that were informal and non-specific, and this  could be related to time pressures to gather and record evidence, a lack of  knowledge and skills to devise and assemble evidence, and a sense that they  were trying to measure unrealistic outcomes (<a href="paper632.html#tod03">Todd, 2003</a>). For example, Andy,  who I interviewed as he attended his first international conference, was  perhaps the least professionally experienced teacher-librarian who participated  in this research. He had a sense of what he needed to do to improve the library  facilities and the way that it interacted with the school community but he  struggled to make sense of how he could be evidence-based in his practice. Here  Andy describes his dilemma:</p>
          <blockquote>I don&#39;t know if I can measure it, I  don't know if I am even measuring the right thing. By all the standards that  come out of the books I may be a dismal failure. I don&#39;t care, but there are  plenty of kids and plenty of parents who reckon that I am doing a reasonable  job, and I can deal with that. Fine, OK. That kid now picks up books and they  share them with their family. And we win.</blockquote>
          <p>Todd (<a href="paper632.html#tod03">2003</a>) suggests that more formal evidence-based  approaches can reveal richer and more precise statements of outcomes, enabling  a more clear articulation of benefits. Contrasting Andy&#39;s dilemma is the  approach taken by Joelle. She was able to evaluate her own performance using  evidence-gathering tools after enrolling in an online course targeted at  librarians to develop skills in the use of quantitative and qualitative  research, and how to use data, statistics, circulation details, student  borrowing and library use activity. Joelle also attended a workshop that  focused on lifting the presentation of the library. She gathered evidence about  what resources were needed by working with teachers on assignment topics so  that she could ensure that the library would be able to provide the print and  online resources, and then she ran professional development for the staff on  the use of databases. Joelle documented these activities and by providing  supporting statistical evidence she was able to build a report for the school  board to advocate for the library and its resources. As a result of these  evidence-based practices and with the support of the school board, she was able  to make many improvements to the ways that the students access information both  on and off campus.</p>
          <p>Among teacher-librarians there appears to be an increasing acceptance  of evidence that can be derived from a variety of sources. There is an  opportunity here to align this more open view of evidence with specific  outcomes that relate to the local environment. Within the profession, this is a  strategy that, when awareness is raised, has potential for improving evidence-based practice for teacher-librarians. </p>
          <p>There were instances where teacher-librarians, on  encountering experiences and observations, used their professional knowledge  and experience to build an evidence base in which they actively engaged with  evidence. In moving from encountered evidence to an engagement with evidence,  teacher-librarians were able to provide creditable measures of success. In  doing so, advocacy for change moves from self-interest, to <em>advocacy with evidence</em> to address real and identifiable needs to  align the library with the learning needs of the school. It was in these  instances that evidence could be used to gain support from school  administrators such as the incident already described when Joan used evidence  to gain the principal's support for introducing cooperative planning and  teaching. Joan moved beyond advocacy when she was able to gain further support  from the principal, when he confirmed that her cooperative approach to teaching  should continue. Although the principal could see that the changes had been  successful, Joan was able to provide supporting evidence of the skills the  students had learned when she plotted them against the education department's  information skills outline.  She was able  to provide real evidence on how the teaching approach was having a positive impact  on student learning. </p>
          <p>Evidence can include work samples, a remark from the  principal, feedback from teachers, observations made of or by students,  borrowing statistics, benchmarks from local and reliable external sources, and  personal reflection. The teacher-librarians in this study had much evidence  that they could draw upon to demonstrate their impact on all aspects of their  involvement in the school community to guide their decision-making and gain  understandings of their own practice. </p>
          <p>This aligns with Boyce (<a href="paper632.html#boy08">2008</a>), who considers that the  fundamental principles of evidence-based practice can be seen in the day-to-day  practice of teacher-librarians. The examples, vignettes and illustrations of  practice highlighted in this research confirm the assertions of Todd (<a href="paper632.html#tod02">2002</a>) and  Boyce (<a href="paper632.html#boy08">2008</a>). However, many of the critical incidents in this research revealed  an encountering of evidence, with a reliance on observation, anecdote and  chance encounter and coincides with a lack of specificity and precision (<a href="paper632.html#tod03">Todd,  2003</a>). teacher-librarians were aware of what they wanted to achieve, but were  unsure about how to articulate and specify these as outcomes. </p>
          <p>The implication is that teacher-librarians need to better  recognise the value of these various types of evidence and apply them, in order  to build an evidence base that demonstrates their contributions to the  academic, social and cultural aspects of the school. However, many of the  participants showed a lack of awareness of encountered evidence and its  possible uses in their evidence-based practice, indicating that for teacher-librarians evidence-based practice is an emerging and under-developed practice. </p>
          <h2>The way forward</h2>
          <p>The empirical model emerging from this research opens the  door for new thinking about evidence-based practice. Although teacher-librarians  were the focus of this study, the findings are not necessarily restricted to  this sector. teacher-librarians are teachers and library and information  professionals, and there is much from the empirical model that can be utilised  within the information and education professions. </p>
          <p>Through reviewing the literature in this area, I can conclude  that no other researchers or practitioners describe evidence-based practice as <em>holistic</em> in nature. The most closely  aligned finding comes from Partridge, Edwards and Thorpe (<a href="paper632.html#par10">2010</a>), who describe  evidence-based practice as an experience rather than a process. Whilst many of  the critical incidents described by participants did not involve an explicit  engagement with evidence gathering and use, they did exhibit a professional  maturity in the ways in which their evidence gathering occurred. They were  continually building their professional knowledge, not through formal research,  but by utilising networking opportunities and exposure to new ideas at  conferences and workshops. These are not formal channels or mechanical  processes. </p>
          <p>To spread the message about evidence-based practice among  teacher-librarians will involve tapping into teacher-librarians&#39; preferred ways  of gaining professional knowledge. This could be likened to creating the ripple  in the pond, where teacher-librarian practitioners spread success stories to  first raise awareness and then, as interest levels and motivation peak, build  professional capacity in workshops and conferences. Less formal approaches  could include blog postings and listserve comments, which could be followed up  with journal articles specific to teacher-librarians. The ripple in the pond  approach, however, tends to keep this valuable information contained within the  profession and there is a need to advocate the power of evidence among the  broader education and information sector. </p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>This article has presented findings about the holistic nature  of evidence-based practice for teacher-librarians and represented this whole  experience in an empirical model (Figure 1). It has revealed that, in this  context, evidence-based practice for teacher-librarians is centred upon the  critical actions of engaging and encountering. While these two actions cannot  occur simultaneously, they can however follow each other, with the coin  constantly flipping between one and the other. This demonstrates the fluid  approach that teacher-librarians use when they find evidence using one action,  for instance deliberate engagement, and then being aware of additional evidence,  perhaps by accidentally receiving it, are able to provide further supporting  evidence of their actions.   The featured examples and vignettes which have  highlighted each of these actions of engaging and encountering, demonstrate  that these actions do not operate in isolation; they are intermingled and  entwined. They contribute to a picture of teacher-librarians' experiences of  evidence-based practice. When viewed together, they reveal that evidence-based  practice can be simple or complex and that evidence-based practice for teacher-librarians is not a linear, step-by-step process. It is beyond this article to  present the complete picture of evidence-based practice for teacher-librarians.  The remaining parts of the  model add further dimensions of evidence-based practice, they give depth and  meaning to the model as a whole and can be explored at another time. </p>
