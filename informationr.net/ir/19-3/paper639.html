<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The ongoing evolution of the Internet and
portable devices has been dramatically changing the business of
delivering news and analysis to readers. Established newspapers,
some in existence for several centuries, have been challenged to
adapt to new channels of content delivery and start updating their
news stream constantly, instead of once or twice a day. At the same
time newspapers have found themselves competing for readers with
new media actors, such as blogs, microblogging platforms, content
aggregators and social curation sites. The circulation of printed
newspapers and magazines in most countries has been dwindling: for
example, in the USA daily circulation of print newspapers fell by
30% from 1990 to 2010 (<a href="paper639.html#ed12">Edmonds, Guskin, Rosenstiel and Mitchell,
2012</a>), although it was stable in 2012 (<a href="paper639.html#ed13">Edmonds, Guskin, Mitchell and Jurkowitz, 2013</a>).</p>
<p>However, these trends are not uniform across
countries. First, there have always been differences between
countries in newspaper readership. Hallin and Mancini (<a href="paper639.html#ha04">2004</a>) found
important differences between newspapers in the Mediterranean,
North and Central European, and North Atlantic countries, such as
the level of partisan division and the level of state involvement
in newspapers (<a href="paper639.html#ha04">Hallin and Mancini, 2004</a>). Second, while print
circulation is falling in much of the developed world, it has been
rising in recent years in countries such as China, India, Mexico
and Saudi Arabia (<a href="paper639.html#ki12">Kilman, 2012</a>; <a href="paper639.html#th13">The Economist, 2013</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, digital and mobile technologies have
to some extent compensated for falling print circulations. Mobile
access is growing fast in developing countries, which accounted for
80% of new mobile subscriptions in 2011 (<a href="paper639.html#in12">International
Telecommunications Union, 2012</a>). Many newspapers have seen
subscribers switch from print to digital and mobile editions
(<a href="paper639.html#ed13">Edmonds <em>et al.</em>, 2013</a>),
although print subscriptions may be cannibalised by digital ones
(<a href="paper639.html#bl11">Bleyen and Van Hove, 2011</a>). Thus an increasing use of portable
devices for content distribution reinforces the transition from
print to digital. Access to media from devices is expected to
overtake access from other platforms (<a href="paper639.html#ni12">Nielsen, 2012</a>). Mobile
Internet traffic has been more than doubling every year and is
anticipated to continue to grow at similar rates in the following
years (<a href="paper639.html#ci12">Cisco, 2012</a>).</p>
<p>At the same time, many of the theories
explaining technology adoption have focused on characteristics of
the new technology and have largely omitted a comparison of the new
technology with the one it is replacing. This comparison
perspective is referred to as technology substitution (<a href="paper639.html#no87">Norton and
Bass, 1987</a>) and has been widely studied in the media domain, where
the focus has been on comparative characteristics of information
dissemination media (radio, television etc.). This paper attempts
to place the technology substitution perspective in conjunction
with individual adopter characteristics.</p>
<p>Digital newspapers started to appear together
with the broad adoption of the Internet in the 1990s. Two major
trends emerged. First, established newspapers rolled out online
editions, which were little more than a digitized print edition,
providing a mix of news and analysis. Second, a new category of
sites emerged that were not affiliated with newspapers. They tended
to provide quick updates and breaking news (<a href="paper639.html#de10">De Waal and Schoenbach,
2010</a>). Currently many newspapers maintain several digital formats:
an e-reader edition formatted for viewing on devices such as
Amazon’s Kindle and Apple’s iPad; a digital replica with the same
content and layout as their print edition to be viewed on a desktop
computer, and a Website which often offers more content. In 2011,
for most of the top 25 US newspapers by circulation, the majority
of subscriptions to a digital version were to the combined e-reader
and digital replica editions, rather than to the Website
(<a href="paper639.html#ed12">Edmonds <em>et al.</em>,
2012</a>).</p>
<p>The debate over whether the Internet has or
will displace print newspapers has continued ever since. There is
evidence that readers of online newspapers have significantly
reduced their consumption of print newspapers but not ceased it
completely (<a href="paper639.html#de10">De Waal and Schoenbach, 2010</a>). Other research found
that Internet-based and printed newspapers are in fact
complementary. People who read more in one channel tend to read
more in the other (<a href="paper639.html#ng06">Nguyen and Western, 2006</a>) and increase the
overall time spent on media consumption (<a href="paper639.html#ne08">Newell, Pilotta and
Thomas, 2008</a>). Interestingly, readers of print newspapers tend to
have higher perceptions of credibility of online news than those
who primarily use the Internet for entertainment (<a href="paper639.html#st08">Stavrositu and
Sundar, 2008</a>).</p>
<p>Recently newspapers began introducing versions
targeted specifically at portable readers with electronic paper
displays (<a href="paper639.html#de10">De Waal and Schoenbach, 2010</a>), such as Amazon’s Kindle
Paperwhite. These devices rely on ambient light, similar to a
printed page and unlike modern smartphone screens, which are
backlit. This reduces eye fatigue (<a href="paper639.html#ju12">Jung, Chan-Olmsted, Park and Kim, 2012</a>). Such displays are comparable to printed text for
legibility (or perform even better, thanks to the ability to change
font size), are superior in functionality (some feature audio or
Internet browsing), but may be inferior in usability (e.g., often
it is not immediately obvious how to change the text to landscape
orientation) (<a href="paper639.html#ju12">Jung <em>et al.</em>,
2012</a>; <a href="paper639.html#no08">Noyes and Garland, 2008</a>; <a href="paper639.html#si10">Siegenthaler, Wurtz and Groner,
2010</a>). Despite that, e-readers have not displaced online or
paper-based books (<a href="paper639.html#gr08">Gregory, 2008</a>). Thus the transition to mobile
digital content distribution of daily newspapers results in
dramatic changes, including the emergence of new business models
and the convergence of different media channels.</p>
<p>This paper focuses on the substitution of
print newspapers with electronic ones. It investigates the
following research question: is the transition from printed to
electronic newspaper influenced by the comparative characteristics
of these two media, by characteristics of individual adopters, or
by both?</p>
<p>To address this research question this study
builds on two theoretical perspectives. First, it applies the
substitution perspective to a technological artefact, the
electronic newspaper. This perspective compares the characteristics
of the existing technology with those of a new one and strives to
determine the relative benefits of adopting a new technology as
opposed to continued use of the existing one. This perspective has
received substantial attention in the media research realm. In
particular this study investigates the comparative characteristics
of electronic newspapers, the new technology, against print
newspapers, the existing technology. Second, it compares the
influence of artefact-specific factors to the impact of individual
characteristics on adoption. Individual characteristics are
conceptualized as cultural factors applied at the individual level
of analysis and artefact factors describe the functionality of the
technology, in this case electronic newspaper. This study explores
any effect that these cultural characteristics might have on
adoption.</p>
<p>We focus on Scandinavian countries, which have
consistently been among the top ten worldwide for newspaper
circulation (<a href="paper639.html#ki12">Kilman, 2012</a>; <a href="paper639.html#un14">UNESCO, 2014</a>). A media culture common to
these countries is characterized by relatively strong partisanship,
high professional standards of journalists and limits on state
power coupled with a tradition of public sector involvement in
media stemming from the welfare states in these countries (<a href="paper639.html#ha04">Hallin
and Mancini, 2004</a>). This can be attributed to the historical
development of newspapers in these countries, where Protestantism
led to an early spread of literacy. Local patriotism, where readers
were seeking local newspapers, even in small towns, also
contributed to the development of a thriving newspaper culture.
Scandinavian countries thus differ in important respects from North
Atlantic countries such as the USA, Canada or the UK. In this
liberal model newspapers tend to be politically neutral, owing to
an early development of commercial newspapers which was not
influenced by the state. Newspapers in Scandinavia are also
different from those in the Mediterranean, where they are often
viewed as a means of political mobilization (<a href="paper639.html#ha04">Hallin and Mancini,
2004</a>).</p>
<p>Our contribution to existing research is
twofold. First, this study informs and enriches existing studies of
technology substitution and the effects of substitution on
adoption. Second, it compares the relative importance of factors
specific to the technology artefact over factors specific to
individuals in technology adoption, thereby potentially identifying
the degree of individual agency in adoption.</p>
<p>The paper is organized as follows: section two
reviews extant literature and advances hypotheses; section three
describes the methodology; section four presents the results;
section five discusses these results and their implications; and
section six concludes the paper.</p>
<h2>Literature review and hypotheses</h2>
<h3>Perceived substitution</h3>
<p>Technology substitution refers to the
replacement of an existing artefact or technology with another,
typically newer, artefact or technology (<a href="paper639.html#no87">Norton and Bass, 1987</a>). At
the individual level, substitution may occur if the new technology
offers greater benefits or higher perceived value compared to that
of the previous one (<a href="paper639.html#br01">Briggs, Nunamaker and Tobey, 2001</a>; <a href="paper639.html#di04">Dimmick,
Chen and Li, 2004</a>; <a href="paper639.html#li01">Lin, 2001</a>). Benefits may be tangible or
intangible and include lower price, greater convenience, higher
usability and greater flexibility (<a href="paper639.html#li06">Lichtenstein and Williamson,
2006</a>). Substitution may take place if benefits derived from the
existing technology no longer meet existing needs of its users, 
when new user needs arise which the existing technology
cannot meet, or when the existing technology is made obsolete by
changes in the environment (<a href="paper639.html#pa04">Paap and Katz, 2004</a>; <a href="paper639.html#sc05">Schmidt and
Druehl, 2005</a>).</p>
<p>Another important consideration is the cost of
switching to the new artefact or technology. At the individual
level these costs depend on the relative complexity of the new
technology or the extent to which it is easier or harder to
understand and handle compared to the old one. This relative
complexity has been shown to be a good predictor of substitution
(<a href="paper639.html#ts10">Tsai, Lee and Wu, 2010</a>).</p>
<p>The replacement of an existing technology with
a new one is not always complete. Sometimes the new technology
replaces only part of the functionality of the existing one and the
existing technology starts providing more specialized functions
(<a href="paper639.html#ne08">Newell <em>et al.</em>, 2008</a>). For
example, vinyl records, once a ubiquitous music listening
technology, are now used only in niche areas, such as nightclubs.
Furthermore, both the existing and the new technologies may change
over time: e.g. their price may decrease or features may improve,
perhaps in response to changes in customer needs (<a href="paper639.html#sc05">Schmidt and
Druehl, 2005</a>). Vinyl records provide a good example. The
functionality of contemporary record players is very different from
those used in the first half of the twentieth century because of
advances in manufacturing and changes in their use.</p>
<p>Substitution may occur through several
scenarios. In multi-generation technologies adopters may either
skip one or more of the previous generations and leapfrog to the
new generation, or adopt the generation that immediately follows
the currently used one (<a href="paper639.html#ji12">Jiang and Jain, 2012</a>).</p>
<p>Substitution is an underexplored research
topic, in the sense that technology adoption studies often do not
consider the extent of change between the old and new technologies
(<a href="paper639.html#xu10">Xu, Venkatesh, Tam and Hong, 2010</a>). At the same time, in many
domains, particularly in mature markets, substitution is much more
prevalent than initial adoption (<a href="paper639.html#go09">Gordon, 2009</a>). This topic has
received more attention in the media domain, in studies of
displacement of existing media by newer ones that provide similar
functionality more easily or attractively (<a href="paper639.html#de10">De Waal and Schoenbach,
2010</a>; <a href="paper639.html#ga12">Gaskins and Jerit, 2012</a>). For example, research on the
transition from print to online newspapers has highlighted the
shift in control and gate-keeping from editors to readers. Because
of the higher amount of content and hyperlinked articles online,
these newspapers let the reader choose among suggested items to
read, unlike print editions which offer editor-picked items to be
read (<a href="paper639.html#de10">De Waal and Schoenbach, 2010</a>). A similar argument is made for
the substitution of radio with MP3 players. MP3 players allow the
user to control what they listen to, unlike radio programming
(<a href="paper639.html#fe07">Ferguson, Greer and Reardon, 2007</a>).</p>
<p>Here, we primarily emphasize the technology
aspect of electronic newspapers (and less so the content aspect).
This drives our selection of variables in the model (e.g.,
perceived substitutive characteristics, perceived usefulness and
perceived ease of use of the technological artefact), as well as a
discussion of the relationship between culture and technology
adoption below. By contrast, if we chose to devote more attention
to the content aspect of electronic newspapers, that would have
called for more emphasis on communication frameworks. Further, the
data collection effort was conducted in 2010, before mass adoption
of electronic newspapers, particularly in the e-reader format.
Therefore hypotheses test the intent to use electronic newspapers,
rather than actual use.</p>
<p>At the same time, substitutive functionality
and benefits of the new technology are sometimes based on
subjective assessments of the customer and thus are not always
rational (<a href="paper639.html#br01">Briggs <em>et al.</em>,
2001</a>). We refer to these subjective substitution assessments as
perceived substitution (<a href="paper639.html#bi97">Bijker, 1997</a>; <a href="paper639.html#bl06">Blue, 2006</a>; <a href="paper639.html#mo03">Morelli, 2003</a>).
An example of perceived substitution in the digital media realm is
the change from video rentals on physical media (e.g., DVD) to
streaming video on demand. The latter provides substitutive
functionality of physical rentals (i.e., video content), with added
functionality whose perceived benefits vary by user, such as wider
title selection and faster availability of content.</p>
<p>Perceived substitution may affect expectations
of the adoption of the new technology based on comparative
characteristics of the existing and the new technologies. Thus we
propose the following hypothesis:</p>
<p><em>H1: Perceived substitution (SUB)
characteristics of electronic newspapers have a positive effect on
the intent to use (IU) electronic newspapers.</em></p>
<p>Further, the perceived substitution concept is
different from perceived benefits of the new technology: unlike
perceived benefits, perceived substitution considers both the
existing and new technologies, as well as any gains from adoption
compared to learning and other costs of adoption. Therefore
perceived substitution may affect the perceived usefulness of the
new technology. Thus we hypothesize:</p>
<p><em>H2: Perceived substitution (SUB)
characteristics of electronic newspapers have a positive effect on
perceived usefulness (PU) of electronic newspapers.</em></p>

<h3>Culture and technology adoption</h3>
<p>This study investigates the effect of culture
at the individual level, since culture is a complex and multi-level
construct that has been defined in a multitude of ways
(<a href="paper639.html#po11">Pogrebnyakov and Maitland, 2011</a>). The basis of culture is
assumptions, values and practices that are attributable to an
individual or shared within a group or country (<a href="paper639.html#le07">Lee, Choi, Kim and Hong, 2007</a>; <a href="paper639.html#ta09">Taras, Rowney and Steel, 2009</a>). These assumptions and
values have an impact on the behaviour of individuals (<a href="paper639.html#di97">DiMaggio,
1997</a>), including behaviour related to the adoption or use of a
particular technology (<a href="paper639.html#er06">Erumban and de Jong, 2006</a>; <a href="paper639.html#le06">Leidner and
Kayworth, 2006</a>). Specifically within the technology adoption realm,
cultural factors have been shown to influence technology adoption
both directly (<a href="paper639.html#er06">Erumban and de Jong, 2006</a>; <a href="paper639.html#le07">Lee <em>et al.</em>, 2007</a>) and as moderators
(<a href="paper639.html#mc07">McCoy, Galletta and King, 2007</a>; <a href="paper639.html#sr06">Srite and Karahanna, 2006</a>; <a href="paper639.html#yo09">Yoon,
2009</a>).</p>
<p>Several authors have stressed the importance
of investigating culture at the individual level when studying
technology adoption (<a href="paper639.html#le07">Lee <em>et
al.</em>, 2007</a>; <a href="paper639.html#le10">Lee, Kim, Choi and Hong, 2010</a>; <a href="paper639.html#li09">Li, Hess,
McNab and Yu, 2009</a>). While many studies operationalize culture as a
country-level factor, others point out that national-level culture
is necessarily an average of cultural characteristics and will not
describe well the culture of each individual in that country
(<a href="paper639.html#le07">Lee <em>et al.</em>, 2007</a>; <a href="paper639.html#ma11">Macfadyen,
2011</a>). Therefore cultural profiles of countries are poor
substitutes for individual cultural characteristics. In particular,
individual technology adoption behaviour will vary between
individuals and will likely be influenced by individual cultural
traits.</p>
<p>We address this methodological and conceptual
consideration by following the approach adopted by Srite and
Karahanna (<a href="paper639.html#sr06">2006</a>) and Yoon (<a href="paper639.html#yo09">2009</a>) and measuring cultural dimensions
at the individual level through a series of questions. We focus on
five commonly used cultural dimensions: individualism, long-term
orientation, masculinity, power distance and uncertainty avoidance
(<a href="paper639.html#ho01">Hofstede, 2001</a>; <a href="paper639.html#tr98">Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner, 1998</a>). These
dimensions were chosen for two reasons. First, they are the most
widely used cultural factors among researchers
(<a href="paper639.html#ta09">Taras <em>et al.</em>, 2009</a>).
These dimensions are also present in many other commonly used
operationalizations of culture (<a href="paper639.html#ta09">Taras<em>et al.</em>, 2009</a>), such as those of Hofstede (<a href="paper639.html#ho01">2001</a>), Schwartz
(<a href="paper639.html#sc94">1994</a>) and Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner (<a href="paper639.html#tr98">1998</a>). Second, as a
result they have been used in a wide variety of contexts, including
technology adoption (<a href="paper639.html#yo09">Yoon, 2009</a>). Following the approach of Yoon
(<a href="paper639.html#yo09">2009</a>) and Lee <em>et al.</em>&nbsp;(<a href="paper639.html#le07">2007</a>) among others, we measure cultural
factors at the individual level. In the following we discuss each
of the five cultural dimensions, their potential influence on
adoption and their proposed influence on the intent to use
electronic newspapers.</p>
<p><em>Individualism (IDV)</em> reflects the extent to which individuals
make their own choices as opposed to relying on opinions and norms
of the group in decision-making (<a href="paper639.html#er06">Erumban and de Jong, 2006</a>; Zakour,
2004). In technology adoption in particular, people with
individualist inclinations tend to focus on their own goals and
satisfaction, rather than those of the group or society (<a href="paper639.html#le07">Lee <em>et al.</em>, 2007</a>). Therefore higher
individualism is associated with greater rates of adoption of new
technologies (<a href="paper639.html#va03">Van Everdingen and Waarts, 2003</a>). Further, the
relationship between technology and individualism is
two-directional, as information and communication technologies may
themselves amplify individualistic behaviour (<a href="paper639.html#st97">Straub, Keil and
Brenner, 1997</a>).</p>
<p>Given these arguments, higher individualism
can be expected to be positively associated with the adoption of
electronic newspapers. Since electronic newspapers are individual
technology artefacts, their adoption is likely to be driven by
individual utilitarian or hedonic considerations, rather than
collective norms. Therefore we hypothesize:</p>
<p><em>H3: Individualism (IDV) has a
positive effect on intent to use (IU) electronic
newspapers.</em></p>
<p><em>Long-term orientation (LTO)</em> describes whether individuals value
tradition and are oriented towards longer-term payoffs, perhaps at
the cost of shorter-term losses (<a href="paper639.html#er06">Erumban and de Jong, 2006</a>;
<a href="paper639.html#ta09">Taras <em>et al.</em>, 2009</a>; <a href="paper639.html#ve01">Veiga,
Floyd and Dechant, 2001</a>; <a href="paper639.html#yo09">Yoon, 2009</a>). As such, this dimension deals
with subjects such as perseverance, thrift, traditions and how
people relate to them. Greater long-term orientation places more
emphasis on established patterns of behaviour and thus is less
likely to be conducive to adoption of new technologies, which often
change established behaviour patterns (<a href="paper639.html#er06">Erumban and de Jong, 2006</a>).
Further, the short-term changes in routines and practices that
often accompany the adoption of new technologies may cause
individuals with greater long-term orientation to see new
technologies themselves as inappropriate. This is likely to cause
the rejection of new technologies (<a href="paper639.html#ve01">Veiga <em>et al.</em>, 2001</a>).</p>
<p>This reasoning suggests that greater long-term
orientation is likely to be detrimental to the adoption of
electronic newspapers and it leads us to the following
hypothesis:</p>
<p><em>H4: Long-term orientation (LTO)
has a negative effect on the intent to use (IU) electronic
newspapers.</em></p>
<p><em>Masculinity
(MAS)</em> entails personal traits such as the
willingness to achieve one’s goals, higher self-confidence and
materiality (<a href="paper639.html#ho01">Hofstede, 2001</a>; <a href="paper639.html#za04">Zakour, 2004</a>). The opposite set of
traits, femininity, puts more value on opinions of others and on
achieving consensus with others (<a href="paper639.html#er06">Erumban and de Jong, 2006</a>; <a href="paper639.html#za04">Zakour,
2004</a>). Because of their greater focus on materiality individuals
with higher masculinity scores can be expected to place more value
on technological artefacts. Further, such individuals may be more
confident that they will be able to use a new technology to their
advantage (<a href="paper639.html#mc07">McCoy <em>et al.</em>,
2007</a>; <a href="paper639.html#va03">Van Everdingen and Waarts, 2003</a>). At the organizational
level, Hofstede (<a href="paper639.html#ho01">2001</a>) indicated that higher masculinity is
associated with higher innovativeness of organizations.</p>
<p>This reasoning suggests that higher
masculinity is likely to be associated with higher degrees of
adoption of electronic newspapers. This gives rise to the following
hypothesis:</p>
<p><em>H5: Masculinity (MAS) has a
positive effect on the intent to use (IU) electronic
newspapers.</em></p>
<p><em>Power distance
(PDI)</em>&nbsp;describes the extent to which people accept
that power is distributed unequally within a group or a society
(<a href="paper639.html#ta09">Taras <em>et al.</em>, 2009</a>).
Higher power distance often implies the reliance on formal rules
and the existence of hierarchical and centralized decision
structures (<a href="paper639.html#er06">Erumban and de Jong, 2006</a>). Individuals in higher
power-distance settings are less likely to experiment with new
technologies. This is because such technologies do not have a
precedent and are less likely to be mandated by superiors, and
therefore such experimentation would require significant autonomous
decision-making. Furthermore, new technologies may facilitate
information exchange between members of a group or society,
independent of their formal position in the hierarchy. Therefore
groups with lower power distance would naturally be more conducive
to adopting new technologies (<a href="paper639.html#za04">Zakour, 2004</a>).</p>
<p>To sum up, power distance and technology
adoption appear to be inversely related. Empirical research
corroborates this reasoning: higher power-distance scores were
found to have a negative relationship with the adoption of
innovations both at the national level (<a href="paper639.html#er06">Erumban and de Jong, 2006</a>;
<a href="paper639.html#va03">Van Everdingen and Waarts, 2003</a>) and at the individual level
(<a href="paper639.html#sh93">Shane, 1993</a>). Thus we hypothesize:</p>
<p><em>H6: Power distance (PDI) has a
negative effect on the intent to use (IU) electronic
newspapers.</em></p>
<p><em>Uncertainty avoidance
(UAI)</em>&nbsp;reflects the degree to which individuals
prefer explicit rules that guide their behaviour (<a href="paper639.html#ta09">Taras <em>et al.</em>, 2009</a>). Individuals with high
uncertainty avoidance are likely to feel uncomfortable in uncertain
situations and be threatened by ambiguity (<a href="paper639.html#er06">Erumban and de Jong,
2006</a>; <a href="paper639.html#yo09">Yoon, 2009</a>). Since adoption of new technology often involves
high degrees of ambiguity, individuals with higher uncertainty
avoidance may be less likely to adopt new technologies (Zakour,
2004). At the organizational level, adoption of innovations is less
likely in organizations with greater uncertainty avoidance, which
often have innovation-constraining rules (<a href="paper639.html#ho01">Hofstede, 2001</a>).
Societies with high uncertainty avoidance have slower adoption
rates for innovations, thus uncertainty avoidance is the most
important cultural variable when examining adoption rates for
innovations (<a href="paper639.html#sh93">Shane, 1993</a>). Further, societies with high uncertainty
avoidance scores are less open to change (<a href="paper639.html#ho01">Hofstede, 2001</a>). It has
been suggested that this reluctance might manifest itself in an
inherent opposition to new technology and thus have a negative
impact on the intent to use (<a href="paper639.html#pn01">Png, Tan and Wee, 2001</a>; <a href="paper639.html#st97">Straub <em>et al.</em>, 1997</a>).</p>
<p>Thus extant literature reveals an inverse
relationship between uncertainty avoidance and technology adoption
at individual, organizational and national levels of analysis.
Therefore we hypothesize:</p>
<p><em>H7: Uncertainty avoidance (UAI)
has a negative effect on the intent to use (IU) electronic
newspapers.</em></p>
<p>Previous studies have found that the intention
to use new technology is positively associated with the absence of
effort required to familiarize oneself with the functionality of
the technology (perceived ease of use) and with the individual’s
evaluation of the utility of the technology (perceived usefulness)
(<a href="paper639.html#ge032">Gefen, Karahanna and Straub, 2003</a>; <a href="paper639.html#yo09">Yoon, 2009</a>). Note that
perceived usefulness is a measure of absolute utility of the
technology, rather than a comparison with another technology with
similar functionality. This makes it distinct from perceived
substitution, which focuses on differences in functionality between
existing and new technologies. Therefore we propose the
following:</p>
<p><em>H8: Perceived ease of use (PEOU)
of electronic newspapers has a positive effect on the intent to use
(IU) them.</em></p>
<p><em>H9: Perceived usefulness (PU) of
electronic newspapers has a positive effect on the intent to use
(IU) them.</em></p>
<p>Finally, and also in line with previous
research, because an easier to use technology is expected to be
more useful (<a href="paper639.html#ge00">Gefen and Straub, 2000</a>), the following hypothesis is
proposed:</p>
<p><em>H10: Perceived ease of use (PEOU)
of electronic newspapers has a positive effect on their perceived
usefulness (PU).</em></p>
<p>The discussion above gives rise to the
conceptual model shown in Figure 1.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
<h3>Data collection</h3>
<p>A nationally representative sample for
Denmark, Norway and Sweden (combined population 19.8 million in
2010 (World Bank, 2014)), was created based on age, sex and
geographic location. These variables were included in the sample to
achieve representativeness and control for distribution of
responses across specific age groups, geographic locations and sex.
Three age groups were used: 18 to 34 years, 35 to 49 years and 50
years and older. Both sexes were included in equal proportions. For
the purposes of this research, the three countries were divided
into geographic regions to properly reflect the distribution of the
population in these countries. Denmark was divided into two
regions: eastern and western. Norway was divided into two regions:
eastern region and other geographic areas. Sweden included three
regions: Götaland, Norrland and Svealand. This division of
geographic areas ensured a mix of urban as well as rural
populations, as well as respondents with varied backgrounds both
economically and educationally. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The original questionnaire was created in
Norwegian. It was pilot tested on a selection of individuals with
knowledge of the media industry, technology industry and those who
did not have an interest or background in either. Pilot testing
resulted in minor changes, primarily semantic ones. The completed
Norwegian original was then sent to native Danish and Swedish
speakers, and after translation subsequently sent to a second
native speaker for evaluation. A few minor changes were made in the
second revision. No full pilot testing was done for the Swedish and
Danish versions. Since the languages are sufficiently similar in
the written form we also reviewed the final questionnaires in each
language before they were sent out to respondents. No changes were
made at this point.</p>
<p>The final questionnaire contained
seventy-three questions, however certain questions were only asked
of certain respondents. For example, when a respondent identified
themself as a student or an employee, they were directed to
questions about their background that were relevant for them, such
as the course of study for students or the type of industry and
position for employees.</p>
<p>Electronic links to the questionnaire were
e-mailed to prospective respondents and the survey was delivered
online. An online only version of the survey was justified because
Internet penetration in the three countries in 2011 was 90%, well
above the 69.6% average for the European Union and European
Economic Area (<a href="paper639.html#eu12">Eurostat, 2012</a>).</p>
<p>Questionnaire items for perceived ease of use,
perceived usefulness and intent to use were constructed following
past research (<a href="paper639.html#lu03">Lu, Yu, Liu and Yao, 2003</a>; <a href="paper639.html#sr06">Srite and Karahanna,
2006</a>; <a href="paper639.html#yo09">Yoon, 2009</a>). Questions for the cultural constructs
(power-distance, individualism, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance
and long-term orientation) were modelled on those used by Yoon
(<a href="paper639.html#yo09">2009</a>). Perceived substitution (SUB) questions were
constructed <em>de
novo</em> based on the literature on
substitution.</p>
<p>A total of 1804 completed responses was
received. The total number of respondents was 594 in Norway (90.6%
response rate), 601 in Sweden (91.2%) and 609 in Denmark (85.6%).
To probe for systematic differences between responders and
non-responders we performed <em>t</em>-tests on age and sex between the two groups
but did not find significant differences.</p>

<h3>Path modelling</h3>
<p>The data in this study were analysed with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_least_squares_regression">partial least squares regression</a>). Partial least squares is a
type of structural equation modelling. There are two ways of
conducting structural equation modelling, namely covariance-based
techniques such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LISREL">LISREL</a>, and variance-based techniques. Partial
least squares is gaining popularity within many different
disciplines and has been the foundation for numerous recent
publications (<a href="paper639.html#he09">Henseler, Ringle and Sinkovics, 2009</a>). It is regarded as particularly useful when
investigating descriptive and predictive relationships (<a href="paper639.html#se97">Sellin and
Keeves, 1997</a>). We used <a href="http://www.smartpls.de/">SmartPLS</a> to analyse the data (<a href="paper639.html#ri05">Ringle, Wende
and Will, 2005</a>).</p>
<p>We followed a two-step procedure described in
<a href="paper639.html#an10">Annear and Yates (2010)</a>. First, to avoid making generalizations
based on incorrect premises, the unidimensionality of the
reflective measures must be assessed. As described in Gefen (<a href="paper639.html#ge03">2003</a>),
the unidimensionality of each latent construct is assumed to exist
only <em>a priori</em>&nbsp;and cannot
be measured directly with partial least squares. Instead, what is
measured is the discriminant and convergent validity of the
reflective measures. Together they make up what is known as
factorial validity, describing how well the measurement items
relate to the latent constructs.</p>
<p>Second, after factorial validity had been
confirmed, we examined and interpreted the path coefficients in the
model. The path coefficients are created by the bootstrapping
procedure which presents the paths in t-test values (<a href="paper639.html#an10">Annear and
Yates, 2010</a>), which allows for straightforward analysis.</p>

<h3>Factorial validity</h3>
<p>Factorial validity demonstrates that
measurement items comprising each factor (e.g., IDV1, IDV2) are
related to only one of the factors (IDV). Establishment of
factorial validity consists of two parts: convergent validity and
discriminant validity (<a href="paper639.html#ge05">Gefen and Straub, 2005</a>).</p>
<p>Discriminant validity is one part required in
demonstrating factorial validity. The analysis is a combination of
two factors and its purpose is to ensure that the measurement items
can be statistically separated from each other (i.e. that they do
not measure the same concept) (<a href="paper639.html#ge05">Gefen and Straub, 2005</a>; <a href="paper639.html#hu99">Hulland,
1999</a>). First, measurement items should load highly on the factor
that has been theorized to include that item but not on other
factors, and the correlation of the latent variable scores with the
measurement items should reflect this pattern of loadings (<a href="paper639.html#ge05">Gefen
and Straub, 2005</a>). There is no clear consensus on how large the
differences in loadings should be, but according to Gefen and
Straub (<a href="paper639.html#ge05">2005</a>) there should be a 0.1 difference between the loadings
of the construct in question compared with loadings on all the
measurement items on any other construct (i.e. if IDV1, 2 and 3
have loadings in the range of 0.7&ndash;0.9, no other measurement item
should be higher than 0.6 on the same construct). As seen in Table
1, the results of confirmatory factor analysis conform to that
requirement. All measurement items have much higher loadings on
their own factor than on the other constructs.</p>

<p>Second, an analysis of the average variance
extracted must be performed. Gefen and Straub (<a href="paper639.html#ge05">2005</a>) proposed the
following rule of thumb: the square root of the average variance
extracted of each latent construct should be at least 0.5, and it
should be much larger than the correlation of that construct with
any other construct in the model. The correlation matrix, average
variance extracted and composite construct reliability are shown in
Table 2.</p>

<p>As shown in Table 2, all constructs satisfy
the average variance extracted requirement stated above. The square
root of the average variance extracted ranges from 0.837 for
masculinity to 0.940 for uncertainty avoidance, which is
significantly higher than the recommended value of 0.5. The square
root of the average variance extracted is also higher than the
correlation coefficient of the construct with the other constructs
for all latent constructs.</p>

<p>Convergent validity is the other part that
completes factorial validity. The condition of convergent validity
is a significant (at least at 0.05 level) <em>t</em>-value loading of each measurement item on its
latent construct (<a href="paper639.html#ge05">Gefen and Straub, 2005</a>). Moreover, it is possible
to look at composite reliability which is computed directly in
SmartPLS. A construct shows acceptable convergent validity if this
score is greater than 0.7 (<a href="paper639.html#hu99">Hulland, 1999</a>). The results of
confirmatory factor analysis show that all constructs have
acceptable item reliability. Table 2 shows composite construct
reliability, which ranged from 0.865 for individualism to 0.957 for
perceived ease of use. These values are higher than the suggested
value of 0.7 (<a href="paper639.html#yo09">Yoon, 2009</a>). Therefore measured factors exhibit
acceptable levels of construct reliability.</p>

<p>As for individual hypotheses, H1 proposed a
positive relationship between perceived substitution and the intent
to use electronic newspaper, and was supported at the 0.01
significance level. H2 posited that perceived substitution is
positively related to perceived usefulness, and was also
supported.</p>
<p>Hypotheses H3 through H7 related the cultural
constructs to the intent to use electronic newspaper. With the
exception of H4, which proposed a negative effect of long-term
orientation on the intent to use and was supported at the 0.05
significance level, none of the cultural constructs were supported
by the analysis.</p>
<p>H8 to H10 were based on previous studies
(<a href="paper639.html#ge032">Gefen <em>et al.</em>, 2003</a>; <a href="paper639.html#ge00">Gefen

H9 posited a positive relationship between perceived ease of use
and perceived usefulness respectively to the intent to use. Both
were supported at the 0.01 significance level. Finally, H10 related
perceived ease of use to perceived usefulness; it too was supported
at 0.01significance level.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<h3>Perceived substitution</h3>
<p>The results of this study suggest a causal
relation between perceived substitution and the intent to use
electronic newspaper. While studies of the effect of substitution
factors on adoption have been performed before (<a href="paper639.html#br01">Briggs <em>et al.</em>, 2001</a>; <a href="paper639.html#li01">Lin, 2001</a>), to the
best of our knowledge this is the first case where perceived
substitution has been compared with cultural factors in their
influence on technology adoption. Thus this study may help bring
new light to what drives consumer adoption.</p>
<p>The results suggest that while the intent to
use electronic newspaper is driven by its perceived usefulness,
this usefulness is in turn influenced by the significant perceived
substitution effect. In other words, whether a new technology is
seen as a good substitute for the existing one is a precursor to
how useful it is perceived to be. This suggests that perceived
usefulness may not be the ultimate determinant of the intent to use
technology and the comparative benefits of the new technology
compared to the existing one may be precursors to the perceived
usefulness of the new technology.</p>
<p>Additionally, perceived substitution may be an
important, and measurable, precursor to technology adoption.
Perceived substitution was found to have a direct positive
influence on the intent to use. This may indicate that the more
electronic newspaper can be made to have the characteristics of a
printed newspaper, with added functionality such as online access
and variable font size, the greater the likelihood of its adoption.
This study was more interested in juxtaposing extant explanations
of adoption, however future studies may investigate the specific
relative weights users give to common and diverging characteristics
of existing and substitutive technologies in finer detail.
Perceived substituting characteristics of a new technology thus
describe expectations of this new technology compared to the
existing one, which may lead to its adoption (<a href="paper639.html#de10">De Waal and
Schoenbach, 2010</a>). While as noted by <a href="paper639.html#br01">Briggs <em>et al.</em>&nbsp;(2001)</a>, these expectations and
perceptions of the substitution effect may not always be rational,
we were able to isolate them and measure their influence on the
intent to use.</p>
<p>This is an important theoretical contribution,
especially when compared with the lack of influence of cultural
factors. Previous studies in the media domain have found
substitution to moderately influence adoption while being
complemented by other factors (<a href="paper639.html#li01">Lin, 2001</a>). By contrast, our results
suggest that the intent to use electronic newspapers is
culture-invariant and is driven primarily by the desire to gain
access to technology that has greater benefits than the existing
one, such as extended functionality, or when the old technology no
longer satisfies user needs (<a href="paper639.html#sc05">Schmidt and Druehl, 2005</a>).</p>
<p>Since this study was conducted prior to
substantive consumer adoption of electronic papers, it captured
customer assessments and expectations of this technology. This is
both a strength and a potential point for improvement. The benefit
of this approach is that even though the technology has not been
offered in the market yet, it is possible to capture customer
attitudes towards adopting this technology. Such an approach is
theoretically in line with previous studies which showed that such
subjective assessments are an important part of the decision to
substitute an existing technology (<a href="paper639.html#br01">Briggs <em>et al.</em>, 2001</a>). On the other hand, we investigate
a relatively complex technology (the electronic newspaper artefact)
which indeed most new technologies are likely to be (<a href="paper639.html#ts10">Tsai <em>et al.</em>, 2010</a>); actual experience of
respondents with electronic newspapers was limited at the time the
survey was conducted, and this may have affected the results. It
also did not allow the research to probe deeper into specific
design and usability differences between print and electronic
paper.</p>

<h3>Culture and technology adoption</h3>
<p>Another aspect of this study is how the effect
of individual-level culture interplays with the intent to use. Only
one cultural variable, long-term orientation, was found to be
statistically significant (at the 0.05 significance
level).</p>
<p>Since the measures of culture were built on
previously successful studies (<a href="paper639.html#sr06">Srite and Karahanna, 2006</a>; <a href="paper639.html#yo09">Yoon,
2009</a>), the lack of influence of individual cultural characteristics
on adoption is an interesting finding. Although some of the
cultural characteristics have been found to not have an influence
on adoption, such as masculinity at the national level (<a href="paper639.html#er06">Erumban and
de Jong, 2006</a>), this absence of support was typically compensated
by the significant influences of other cultural characteristics.
This lack of influence may be caused by an explanation offered by
Srite and Karahanna (<a href="paper639.html#sr06">2006</a>), who suggested that cultural values may
play different roles depending on the stages of the acceptance
process, especially at the initial acceptance or adoption decision.
The results of this study support this argument. At initial stages
of the adoption process substitution factors may play a far more
significant role than cultural variables. Culture was measured at
the individual level, as adoption of electronic newspapers is
viewed as an individual decision. National cultural characteristics
typically do not describe well individual variations in culture
(<a href="paper639.html#le07">Lee <em>et al.</em>, 2007</a>) and thus
may not be a good explanatory variable in the adoption model. This
is a possible avenue for future research.</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This study conducted an analysis of the
influence of perceived substitution as well as cultural factors on
the intent to use electronic newspapers. It used data from three
Scandinavian countries: Denmark, Norway and Sweden. All three have
very high levels of newspaper readership and similarly structured
newspaper markets (<a href="paper639.html#ha04">Hallin and Mancini, 2004</a>), making them an
excellent setting for an investigation of the change of a new
technological artefact for delivering newspaper content such as
electronic newspapers.</p>
<p>The results suggest that the influence of
perceived substitution on both perceived usefulness and the intent
to use electronic newspapers is significant, while the effect of
cultural dimensions on the intent to use is not. This indicates
that characteristics of electronic newspaper may be an important
driver of adoption while cultural characteristics of potential
users may not be. This is an important finding given two
countervailing trends. On one hand, print newspaper circulation has
been falling in many countries (typically in the developed world)
but rising in some (<a href="paper639.html#ki12">Kilman, 2012</a>; <a href="paper639.html#th13">The Economist, 2013</a>). On the
other hand, the adoption of digital and mobile technologies, which
are often used to access newspaper content, is increasing in most
countries, with many having reached saturation levels
(<a href="paper639.html#in14">International Telecommunications Union, 2014</a>). This study draws
attention to the characteristics of a technology artefact that may
facilitate this transition from print to electronic newspapers,
which may be more significant than cultural characteristics of the
potential consumer. Further studies focusing on other technologies
or geographies may shed more light on the extent to which common
and diverging characteristics of existing and substitutive
technologies are valued by consumers.</p>
<p>From the practical perspective, the
significant effect of perceived substitution suggests that the
focus for managers should be to explain to consumers how the
electronic newspaper will function as a direct substitute for the
printed newspaper and how it is useful in their everyday life. This
might be achieved by explaining how the technological advantages
inherent in the product improve a product many Scandinavians have a
very personal relationship with (<a href="paper639.html#ih05">Ihlstr&ouml;m and Henfridsson, 2005</a>).
It should be considered an additional bonus that consumers
generally seem to be technologically confident enough to operate
the electronic newspaper once acquired and do not perceive a new
electronic device in their daily life to offer any particular
problems.</p>
<p>At the same time, we did not focus on
the <em>extent</em>&nbsp;to which
print newspapers may be substituted by electronic ones. While this
was not our intent, there is currently a lively debate on that
subject, with some studies finding evidence for an overall increase
in media consumption, and thus electronic newspapers, among others,
playing a complementary role to other media channels (<a href="paper639.html#ne08">Newell <em>et al.</em>, 2008</a>; <a href="paper639.html#ng06">Nguyen and Western,
2006</a>); while others highlight that online newspaper readership
significantly reduced consumption of print versions (<a href="paper639.html#de10">De Waal and
Schoenbach, 2010</a>). The perceived substitution construct and our
theoretical model in principle do not rule out significant
displacement of print newspapers by electronic ones, with print
newspapers being left in a niche that caters to specific and narrow
customer segments. Such incomplete substitution has been observed
with other technologies (<a href="paper639.html#ne08">Newell <em>et al.</em>, 2008</a>), such as vinyl records.</p>
<p>This study necessarily has limitations. It
relied only on a quantitative methodology, which can be
complemented by qualitative methods to probe deeper into the
relationship between substitution, culture and the intent to use
electronic newspapers. Participant observation and focus groups
could also be used to investigate design differences between
electronic and print newspapers in detail, and thus the relative
importance of design factors in substitution.</p>
<p>Future research could use the results of this
study in several ways. First, the relationship between perceived
substitution and actual use should be established, since the link
between the intent to use and actual use can be tenuous. Second,
this study can be replicated in other industries and with other
technological artefacts to determine whether the results here apply
primarily to the media industry or similar effects can be seen in
other industries too.</p>
