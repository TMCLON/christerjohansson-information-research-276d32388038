 <h2>Introduction</h2> 
 
 <p>  More than half (52%) of the adult population in the European Union is overweight or obese and in 
many countries the rate of obesity has doubled over the past twenty years (<a href="paper633.html#oec12">OECD, 2012</a>). European states 
conduct a variety of policy interventions aimed at preventing obesity and related diseases, among which 
informational and educational interventions are the most common and are highly acceptable to consumers 
(<a href="paper633.html#per11">P&eacute;rez-Cueto <em>et al.</em>, 2011 </a>). To be effective these interventions have to keep pace with the changing 
information behaviour of consumers and should take into consideration their health information literacy, 
one of the important components of health literacy (<a href="paper633.html#mor12"> M&aring;rtensson and Hensing, 2012 </a>; <a href="paper633.html#fri12">Frisch, Camerini, Diviani and Schulz, 2012 </a>; 
<a href="paper633.html#kic04"> Kickbusch, 2004 </a>; <a href= "paper633.html#gas999">Norman and Skinner, 2006 </a>; <a href="paper633.html#mcc11"> McCormack, Rush, Kandula and Paasche-Orlow, 2011 </a>), and even more specifically, their nutrition information literacy. </p>
 
 <p>Information behaviour, as defined by Wilson</p>
 
<blockquote> encompasses activities a person may engage in when identifying his or her own needs for information, searching for such information in any way, and 
using or transferring that information.  (<a href="paper633.html#wil99">1999, p. 249 </a>)</blockquote> 

<p>Health information literacy, as defined by the Medical Library Association Health Information Literacy Task Force, </p>

<blockquote>is the set of abilities needed to: recognize health 
information needs, identify likely information sources and use them to retrieve relevant information; 
assess the quality of the information and its applicability to a specific situation; and analyze, understand,
 and use the information to make good health decisions" (<a href="paper633.html#shi09">Shipman, Kurtz-Rossi and Funk, 2009 </a>).</blockquote> 
 
<p> Health information literacy  is a crucial competency of 21st century health services for consumers and patients. Its growing importance 
is caused by radical changes in the information environment and technology, which on one hand have made 
information users much more independent in their information behavior. On the other hand,  it has put them 
at a greater risk of using unreliable or manipulated information. This set of abilities has to be placed 
among individual determinants of information behaviour (Wilson calls them: personal intervening variables). 
The best way to understand the level of these abilities would be to directly examine the information related 
knowledge and check the information skills of a target group. But, some insight can be also obtained by 
asking people how they behave: what sources of information they choose, what their preferences are, etc. </p> 
 
 <p>Health information literacy, when limited to information regarding diets and its effects on health and 
healthy eating, can be described more specifically as <em>nutrition information literacy</em>, and this more 
specific term will be used in this paper. A large amount of nutrition information is at present available 
and accessible to an increasing share of the population through the explosion of the Internet. The use of 
this media for general health related purposes shows an increasing trend (<a href="paper633.html#kum08"> Kummervold <em>et al.</em>, 2008</a> ), and in 2011, 
54% of European Union citizens looked for such information on the Internet (<a href="paper633.html#sey11"> Seybert, 2011 </a>). Other competing information 
providers remained, e.g., popular magazines, TV, social media, family members, and marketing companies. The 
information they disseminate can be very subjective (e.g., discussion lists, blogs), contradictory 
(e.g., recommendations to stimulate seafood consumption for its health benefits versus risk messages about 
the content of environmental pollutants in seafood and the dangers of depleting seafood stocks (<a href="paper633.html#ver08"> Verbeke, Vanhonacker, Frewer, Sioen, De Henauw and Van Camp, 2008 </a>), commercially driven (e.g., food products advertised as healthy) or difficult to comprehend. All this entails the risk 
of leaving consumers confused or just indifferent. A special Eurobarometer study conducted in 2006 revealed the 
following responses to the question: what makes healthy eating difficult. 16% responded with the answer: '<em>lack of 
information about the food I eat</em>'; for 15% of respondents, it was: '<em>information about healthy eating is contradictory
and confusing</em>' and for 12%: '<em>lack of information about what constitutes a healthy diet</em>'. Altogether, these three barriers
 make '<em>information about healthy eating</em>' the most spontaneously mentioned barrier among citizens (<a href="paper633.html#eur06"> Eurobarometer, 2006 </a>).
This barrier exists partially because people do not have an adequate level of nutrition information literacy: they cannot 
find good nutrition information and are not able to assess and use it. </p> 
 
 <p>There are several research studies conducted into health literacy of consumers (in general)  or even 
health information literacy (<a href="paper633.html#ber11">Berkman, Sheridan, Donahue and Viswanathan, 2011</a>;<a href="paper633.html#iva06"> Ivanitskaya, O'Boyle and Casey, 2006 </a>;<a href="paper633.html#shi09"> Shipman et al., 2009 </a>; <a href="paper633.html#yat09"> Yates, 
Partridge and Bruce, 2009 </a>; <a href="paper633.html#eri12">Eriksson-Backa, Ek, Niemel&auml; and Huotari, 2012 </a>; <a href="paper633.html#nie12">Niemel&auml;, Ek, Eriksson-Backa and Huotari, 2012 </a>), including the recent European Union Health Literacy 
Survey (<a href="paper633.html#pel12">Pelikan, R&ouml;thlin and Ganahl, 2012 </a>), but not many deal specifically with nutrition literacy or  nutrition 
information literacy. Nutrition literacy studies usually focus on readability and numeracy of patients 
and their communication with doctors in the area of dieting and nutrition. A review of  thirty-three 
studies approaching nutrition problems concerning health literacy was done by Carbone and Zoellner (<a href="paper633.html#car12">2012</a>) 
and by Gibbs and Chapman-Novakofski (<a href="paper633.html#gib12">2012</a>), who also proposed  a nutrition literacy working definition 
which includes knowledge of nutrition principles (capacity to obtain knowledge) and <em>how to</em> knowledge 
(skills needed).</p> 

<p>Research focusing on nutrition information literacy is very rare and usually targets 
specific or just convenient groups: pregnant women (<a href="paper633.html#szw05">Szwajcer, Hiddink, Koelen and van Woerkum, 2005</a>), adolescents 
(<a href="paper633.html#lar11">Larsen and Martey, 2011</a>), nutrition science faculty (<a href="paper633.html#shp11">Shpilko, 2011</a>), 
athletes (<a href="paper633.html#abd11">Abdullah and Mal-Allah, 2011</a>), 
inhabitants of the Lower Mississippi Delta (<a href="paper633.html#zoe09">Zoellner, Connell, Bounds, Crook and Yadrick, 2009</a>). There has been no investigation into 
the nutrition information literacy of the general public in Europe. This study set out to obtain some insight in this 
area, and to investigate knowledge of nutrition information sources among citizens of selected European 
countries. Its aim is to find out how people seek healthy eating related information, whether they 
encounter any problems in finding it, and to establish what determines their information behaviour. 
The study was limited to few aspects of health information behaviour and literacy since it was only a 
part of a larger Eatwell survey and not the main focus of it. To obtain a complete and more detailed 
picture of nutrition information literacy of Europeans, further studies are needed.</p> 
 
 <p> This study set out to answer a number of key questions: do consumers know where to find healthy eating 
information? What sources of information do they use and how often? Additionally are there any patterns or 
socio-demographic and environmental determinants of their nutrition information literacy and behaviour? </p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<h3>Survey design.</h3>

<p>The study on nutrition information literacy of European consumers was part of a wider 
cross sectional survey into the effectiveness of nutrition policies within the EU-funded Eatwell project. 
The survey questionnaire (translated and back translated) was administered in five countries: UK, Italy, 
Belgium, Denmark and Poland. It was a convenience choice, dictated by the nationality of the project 
partners. Field work was sub-contracted to GfK NOP Ltd., an international market research company, which 
abides by the International Chamber of Commerce/The European Society for Opinion and Market Research 
code on market and social research complying to ethical rules which are in line with 
international ethics standards. The agency was selected through a competitive European call and provided 
the researchers with anonymous and non-identifiable data records. Ethical clearance was obtained from 
the University of Reading ethics board. The survey was administered on-line through computer assisted 
Web interviewing (hereafter, Web interviewing) in each country, while a validation survey to check for potential on-line biases 
was done using a shorter version of the questionnaire and a double administration method using Web interviewing and   
computer assisted telephone interviewing in two of the five surveyed countries 
(UK and Italy). In the validation study it was found that there are few differences between Internet 
users and non-users, for respondents below fifty five. The survey took place between the 7th and the 
22nd of February 2011. Sample extraction was based on disproportional stratified sampling from the GfK 
e-panel (414,000 potential respondents, age 16+, in the five countries), using age and sex as 
stratification variables. The invitations to take part were sent to the respondents. The required 
sample sizes were achieved via oversampling and by appropriate replacement procedures also based on 
age and gender matching. The response rate (proportion of complete interviews) was 18.7% (ranging 
between 11% in Belgium and 27% in Italy). No particular demographic patterns were found in non-responses.</p>

<h3>Questionnaire</h3>.

<p>In the design of the questionnaire, the project drew questions from pre-existing 
instruments (<a href="paper633.html#oli05">Oliver and Lee, 2005</a>; <a href="paper633.html#sti07">Stirling, Lobstein, Millstone and PorGrow Research Team, 2007</a>; <a href="paper633.html#mil07">Millstone and Lobstein, 2007</a>). To test whether the questionnaire is reliable a small scale test-retest study (120 respondents, an interval 
of three weeks) was set-up in Belgium. The pilot survey was run in November 2010 to finalise the 
questionnaire. Out of forty-seven questions in the Eatwell survey, eleven regarded looking for 
nutrition information or respondents' beliefs and attitudes towards informational or educational 
interventions and policies in the area of nutrition information provision. Questions regarding 
personal socio-demographic characteristics, psychological and lifestyle determinants and environmental 
factors were used to explore patterns and look for determinants of the respondents' nutrition 
information literacy and behaviour. </p> 

<h3>Statistical analysis </h3>

<p>In statistical analysis of the results the post-stratification weights were 
applied to reflect the population stratum sizes by gender and age, both within the country and across 
countries. Where necessary, derived variables were developed, for example, body mass index from stated 
weight and height. For all monetary variables, consistency across different currencies was ensured by 
considering both the exchange rates and the different cost of living by applying purchasing power 
parities. The resulting conversion coefficient was rounded to produce meaningful rates. 
The harmonised education variable developed to account for international differences in education 
systems, had been built on three education levels: high (university-level diploma and higher, 
completed at age 21 or later, after 15 years of education or more), medium (lower secondary education, 
completed at age 18, after 12-14 years of education), low (primary and lower secondary education, 
completed at age 13-15, after 8-11 years of education). Descriptive statistics and tabulation were 
used to analyse the simple proportional differences across various socio-demographic factors. 
Regression analysis was used to analyse the influence of social, demographic, psychological and 
economic characteristics on the information seeking of the respondents.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>

<p> A total of 3,003 respondents, age 16+, completed the questionnaire (600 in each country, except UK with 603). All of the presented results are significant 
with p&lt;0.05, unless stated differently. Table 1 presents the characteristics of the sample. </p>

<p>Over 33% of respondents claimed on average twenty or more hours per week spent on the Internet, with 
differences between countries: 44% in the UK, 39% of Poles, 30% of Italians and Belgians and 21% of Danish.  
Approximately 1% of the respondents spend less than one hour or do not use the Internet at all. 97% of the 
total sample used the Internet at home. Men's active use of the Internet exceeds that of women by about 
two hours per week, and the length of time spent decreases with age.</p>

<p>In terms of attribution of obesity, 40% of those surveyed stated that people are overweight because 
'<em>they lack information about healthy eating and health risks of excess weight</em>' (56% of Italians, 47% of 
Poles, 35% of Danes, 32% of Belgians and 30% of UK respondents). 63% of respondents agree that the 
government should spend money on information campaigns informing people about the risks of unhealthy 
eating.  The support is largest in Italy (81%) and the smallest in Denmark (48%). Also, 85% of all 
respondents support educational interventions aimed at children (with small differences across countries), 
product labelling is supported by 81% of the surveyed. Education of adults (e.g., workplace trainings) 
and information on restaurant menus received less support, respectively 50% and 51%. (Answers to the 
questions are presented in Tables 2-6.</p>

<p>42.8% of those surveyed do not know where to find information about healthy eating (Table 1). 
A logistic regression model which considered a variety of socio-demographic determinants shows 
that there are big differences across countries. Relative to UK respondents, Danes are about 2.6 
times and Italians about twice more likely to know where to find nutrition information (know the 
sources of information). Belgians were found to be the least knowledgeable in this respect, with 
half of the probability relative to the UK respondents. No significant difference emerges between 
the British respondents and the Polish ones. Figure 1 presents the percentage of respondents who know 
where to look for information and the odds ratios obtained through the logistic regression model. 
The latter statistics indicate how much country variability can be ascribed to geographical variation 
after accounting for other explanatory factors like age, education, gender, food preferences, 
and location where internet is accessed.</p>

<p>Obesity and gender do not influence knowledge of nutrition information sources, but with every 
year of age, awareness of existing sources of information improves by 0.7%. This also increases for 
higher education levels. The probability that a highly educated person knows where to look for 
nutrition information is 2.24 times higher than for the less educated. Probability also grows if 
a person suffers from a chronic nutrition related disease (increase by 41%). </p>

<p>Respondents were asked how frequently they use certain sources of nutrition information. 
Their choices were restricted to: never, less than once a month, every week, not every week 
but more than once a month. In logistic regression analysis the association between Body mass 
Index and frequency of using nutrition information sources did not turn out to be significant (p>0.05). 
There are significant differences between men and women, between surveyed nationalities, and a 
strong correlation between the level of education and frequency of seeking information. Those who 
claim that they do not seek nutrition information are mostly men, low educated, and among studied 
populations &dash; UK respondents. Nutrition related information is sought more frequently by women 
(21% increased probability), highly-educated respondents (49% increase), and those with diagnosed 
health problems (increase between 20-30%), (p&lt;0.05). Danish respondents are most likely to seek 
nutrition information in books, magazines or TV, followed by Poles, Italians, Belgians, and UK 
respondents. Probability in comparison with the UK grows in these countries respectively by 187% 
(Denmark), 82% (Poland), 67% (Italy) and 30% (Belgium). In regard to searching the Internet the 
Italians take the lead. The probability that an Italian seeks nutrition information on the Internet 
is 126% higher than for a British person, for Polish - 79% higher, Danish - 45% higher, 
and Belgians - 36% higher (p&lt;0.05). </p>


<p><b>Where do respondents seek information? </b>The list of possible information sources was intentionally 
short, and did not include detailed Internet sources such as: discussion forums or blogs, or in case of 
personal sources included only doctors. The goal of this set of questions was to distinguish between 
virtual and personal communication, and between professional and unprofessional sources.  Asked this 
question, most of the respondents in all countries point to the Internet as the main source of diet 
related information. 60.7% of all respondents use search engines like Google, 48.1% use specialised 
web sites (Table 4, Figure 2).</p>

<p>The correlation between age and body-mass index and the kind of sources used did not appear to be significant (p&gt;0.05).
 But, there are significant differences between men and women, among the nationalities, and a correlation 
with the level of education.  Women are 42% more likely to look for nutrition information in magazines 
than men. The higher the level of education the more probable it is that people seek diet related 
information in sources more likely to be reliable, like web pages endorsed by nutrition specialists or GPs.
 The chance that a person with medium or higher education seeks nutrition related information from a given 
source in comparison with a person with low education grows relatively by 48% and 94%. </p>

<p>There are also country related differences in regard to seeking information at specialised (endorsed by 
nutrition specialists) websites (Table 3). Poles and Italians are respectively 119% and 48% more likely to 
look for information from specialised sources than UK respondents. When it comes to seeking nutritional 
advice from GPs, however, British respondents are in the middle among the surveyed populations, with 
Italians and Belgians more likely, and Danish (52%) and Polish less likely to do so.
People with concerns about their weight were more likely to consult their GPs for information about diet, 
although this increases by only 6%. The probability also grows if a person is chronically ill. 
The chance that a diabetic or hypercholesterolemic person will seek nutrition information from a GP 
grows respectively by 55% and 51%, in comparison with one with no chronic condition.  </p>

<p>The better the economic situation of the respondents the less likely (decrease by 9%) they are to ask 
their GPs for nutrition information. They look for such information in magazines and the Internet on a more 
frequent basis (probability increases by 12%). </p>

<p>From table five above, the survey shows that 7.5% of all respondents never read nutrition labels before
 purchasing food products. 22.4% do this every time when buying something new. Occasionally and for 
some products, 35.1% read nutrition labels, and 35% of respondents read nutrition labels most of the time. 
Proportional odds logistic regression applied to this answer uncovers that: men, people with low education, 
with self-assessed poor health, read labels less frequently than women, highly educated people and those 
who see their health as good. Labels are read more often by people with diagnosed chronic conditions. 
The respondents from all considered countries read nutrition labels more frequently than the UK respondents. 
The probability that an Italian, a Pole or a Dane will read a label "every single time he/she buys 
something new" rather than "often" increases in comparison with UK consumers respectively by 206% (Italy),
 137% (Poland) and 43% (Denmark). Belgians also seem to do this more often than their UK counterparts 
(probability increases by 6%) but here the result is non-significant (p=0.334). </p>

<p>Italians lead in the opinion that the lack of nutrition information about healthy eating and lack 
of information about health risks of being overweight can be the causes of obesity. Over 55% of Italians 
agree with this statement, while the average for the whole sample of respondents is 40%. </p>

<p>Asked how serious a problem obesity is to society, respondents in the whole sample placed this risk as 
the fourth biggest, after cancer, heart diseases and drinking, with the British seeing obesity as the 
biggest problem, and Italians and Polish as one of the smallest. </p>

<p>Among different information measures aimed at controlling weight and promoting healthy eating, on 
average 64% of the respondents would support government information campaigns, 81% would support labelling 
of food products, 51% are for providing nutritional information on restaurant menus, and 85% of the 
respondents would support education measures aimed at children at schools (Table 6). </p>

<h2> Discussion </h2>
<p>The results of the survey give some insight into nutrition information behaviour and information literacy 
of respondents and revealed certain determinants of their information activity. The limitation to only 
5 countries (convenience sample) does not allow for European generalisation. However because the 
participating countries differ in economical and geographical aspects (as well as in the culture of eating), 
observations of similar patterns are likely to apply to other countries. As mentioned in the introduction, 
the study was a part of a larger survey and this explains why only a limited range of health information 
literacy and information behaviour components were covered. To obtain a complete and more detailed picture, 
further field and experimental studies are needed. </p>

<p>In light of the described survey results, nutrition information behaviour and literacy is strongly 
correlated with individual and environmental characteristics. Some of these correlations are not surprising 
and were discovered in earlier studies including: higher engagement in health information seeking by women 
(<a href="paper633.html#lor07">Lorence and Park, 2007</a>; <a href="paper633.html#urq09">Urquhart and Yeoman, 2009</a>), positive correlation of health information literacy with 
increase of education level and income (<a href="paper633.html#ren08">Renahy, Parizot and Chauvin, 2008</a>), more frequent searches for health information 
by people with chronic conditions (related to a higher personal involvement in food purchasing and 
consumption decisions. The chance that a diabetic or hypercholesterolemic person will seek nutrition 
information from a GP grows respectively by 55% and 51%, in comparison with one with no chronic condition). 
The last finding is consistent with research done by Fuller, Backett-Milburn and Hopton (<a href="paper633.html#ful03">2003</a>) who 
found that family doctors play a bigger role in nutrition communication when patients have something 
wrong with them. In contrast to the last ones (chronically ill) the respondents who just self-assess 
their health as poor seek information less frequently. Chronic disease probably forces people to engage 
more in the self-management of their condition and increases the level of health knowledge, including 
knowing and using helpful information sources.</p>

<p>Italians and Danes appear to be the most nutrition information literate, both being familiar with diet 
related information sources. Italian respondents demonstrated a high concern for their own health and 
strongly agreed with the statement that "lack of appropriate nutrition information can be one of the 
causes of being overweight". Danish respondents also displayed an awareness of obesity as a serious 
social problem.  This could be explained by research which indicates that health information seeking 
is positively correlated with health consciousness and strong beliefs (<a href="paper633.html#dut05">Dutta-Bergman, 2005</a>). Polish 
respondents, who do not consider obesity to be a big health risk, are probably less interested in 
looking for nutrition information that would help them eat well. The case and numbers for Belgium are 
also striking in this respect. Despite a wealth of information about food and health from many public 
and private initiatives, Belgian citizens claim to be largely unaware about where to find nutrition 
information. Overload, multi-source origin (including different levels of government involvement in 
communicating food and health information) may partly explain this situation. </p>

<p>In light of obtained results, obese individuals are not less likely to know where to find nutrition 
information than normal-weight respondents. This result might be caused by social desirability bias, 
probable in answering these types of questions. Some obese respondents may want to show they are doing 
the 'right thing', which may affect the ability of the survey to capture differences. A different 
methodological approach would be needed to investigate the relation between obesity and nutrition 
information literacy more closely.  </p>

<p>Environment related influences are not easily explicable and require further research. Danish and 
Italian respondents self-reported much better knowledge of nutrition information sources than the 
remaining respondents, and the last ones also claim to use more trustworthy sources of information, 
like GPs, nutrition specialist (<a href="paper633.html#nic03">Nicholas, Pond and Roberts, 2003</a>). A question arises: why are Danes almost 
three times more likely to claim familiarity with sources of diet related information in comparison
 with Poles? Is the nutrition education or health information education of the Danish and Italian 
population so much better? Is it that their nutrition information sources are easier to locate? In 
Poland indeed, reliable nutrition information (i.e. information endorsed by a reliable institution, 
publicly known, governmental, or one that provides appropriate credentials)  is hard to find.  
Simple Google.pl searches using the phrase "healthy eating" (in Polish: zdrowe od&zdot;ywianie), 
conducted for the purpose of this discussion, resulted in approx. 2,400,000 links. However, 
the first several pages of Google's results did not produce any reliable healthy nutrition sites. 
Links directed the searcher to Internet stores with "healthy food" and to commercial food and 
dieting services. In light of research that suggests that the first three results of a Google search 
receive 58% of Internet users attention (<a href="paper633.html#goo11">Goodwin, 2011</a>), this is not good news.  </p>

<p>When the Italian Google search engine was used, depending on the order of words in the phrase: 
"sana alimentazione" one could get public (reliable) sites with healthy diet information 
(like INRAN or EUPHIC) or websites of unknown credentials and quality. Similarly in Denmark or Belgium, 
depending on the search terms used, and depending on individual searching skills, a consumer can 
obtain trusted nutrition information endorsed by a public body. The risk of finding commercially 
driven diet information was also high. Finding reliable sources depends therefore on the Internet 
users' information skills (especially the ability to assess the reliability of information source).
 Marshal and Williams (<a href="paper633.html#mar06">2006</a>) found that one of the two most important indicators of quality of health 
information for consumers was organisational authority, and participants in this study demonstrated a 
lack of confidence about their ability to select quality health information. The difficulty of finding 
reliable nutrition information can be solved by appropriate education and positioning of public 
information sources on the Internet. </p>

<p>Another question resulting from the analysis is why British respondents claim much lower nutrition 
information seeking activity in comparison to other nationalities? Does it mean that their nutrition/health 
information literacy is insufficient? A study conducted in 2007 indicated that around 11% of adults surveyed 
in the British population have marginal or inadequate health literacy (<a href="paper633.html#wag07">Wagner, Knight and Steptoe, 2007</a>). This is not bad, 
considering results of research (yet to be published but presented in November 2011 at The European Health
 Literacy Conference in Brussels) into the health literacy of populations of eight European countries.  
The results suggest that approximately 46% of the Europeans have "inadequate" or "problematic" health literacy. 
The relative inactivity of the British in seeking nutritional information probably cannot be explained by their 
lower than average health literacy level.  Could the cause arise from too much information? ComScore data says 
that the UK emerges as the largest market for Health sites (<a href="paper633.html#aze12">Azevedo, 2012</a>). A search done on Google.uk on 
24 October 2012 retrieved 807,000,000 "healthy eating" links.  The first three links led to public reliable sources 
of information which could be easily found by the British population. Could  the phenomenon known as "paradox of choice" 
explain this claimed inactivity? It happens when people with too many potentially useful sources neither use them nor 
choose rationally (<a href="paper633.html#baw09">Bawden and Robinson, 2009</a>). </p>

<p>Nutrition was reported long ago to be among the fastest-growing areas of interest and one of the main 
health topics people search for when surfing the Internet (<a href="paper633.html#kou01">Kouris-Blazos, Setter and Wahlqvist, 2001</a>). Its popularity as 
a nutrition information source among survey respondents is therefore not surprising. It is also consistent 
with many studies which show how the Internet and general search engines, like Google are increasingly 
used for health related purposes (<a href="paper633.html#fox09">Fox and Jones, 2009</a>; <a href="paper633.html#zic10">Zickuhr, 2010</a>; <a href="paper633.html#wan12">Wang et al., 2012</a>). 
It has to be noticed, that when asked "where they look for information?" most of the respondents in the Eatwell 
survey in all countries point at the Internet. However, answering the question about frequency of looking 
for diet related information in various sources,  they are not that sure, and the difference between 
frequency of seeking information on Internet and in "books, magazines and TV" is not that big and sometimes 
in favour of the last. Why this inconsistency occurred needs further investigation. </p>

<p>What is disturbing is that a prevailing number of respondents claimed the use of Google as a means of 
finding nutrition information on the Internet (the highest percentage in Denmark - 72%).  Fewer respondents 
claimed to refer directly to online nutrition services. Although the use of Google does not exclude the 
possibility that the engine is used only instrumentally as a tool to finally reach a professional 
reliable source, it is also probable that the respondents rely on Google algorithms and settle with 
sources which come first, paying little attention to the quality of the sites (<a href="paper633.html#fox06">Fox, 2006</a>). Internet 
content study done by Sutherland, Wildemuth, Campbell and Haines (<a href="paper633.html#sut05">2005</a>) revealed that nutrition web sites obtained using 
popular search engines often provide inaccurate nutrition information. Other researchers stated 
that accessingaccurate, easy-to-understand, and reliable information on the Internet is time-consuming 
and can be very frustrating (<a href="paper633.html#und06">Underbakke, McBride and Spencer, 2006</a>; <a href="paper633.html#jos11">Joshi, Bhangoo and Kumar, 2011</a>). </p>

<p>In the survey presented here only 7.5% of all respondents claimed they never read nutrition labels on 
packages before purchasing food products. This shows a high level of awareness of this source of nutrition 
information but nevertheless has to be put into perspective. The European Food Information Council observational 
study conducted in 2008  revealed that  only a minority (less than one-third) of consumers  look for this 
information on the food packaging (<a href="paper633.html#gru09">Grunert and Wills, 2009</a>).</p>

<p>Finding answers to the questions above requires further investigation, especially into the reasons of national 
differences in nutrition information seeking and the factual nutrition information literacy skills of consumers. 
The surveyed sample was limited to Internet users, which can be seen as a limitation, but if future interventions 
aimed at changing eating behaviour are in focus the possible respondents selection bias can be, in authors' opinion, 
neglected. Data says that already over 90% young European population uses Internet, more than half uses the internet 
almost every day (<a href="paper633.html#tro08">Trotter and Morgan, 2008</a>) and there is immense increase in popularity of social Internet, like Facebook, 
Twitter (<a href="paper633.html#fox11">Fox, 2011</a>). Additionally, potential systematic differences between the on-line 
and off-line sub-groups of the populations were checked in a validation study and it was found that there are few 
significant differences between internet users and non-users for those below fifty five.</p>

<h2>Conclusions </h2>

<p>Despite a wealth of nutrition information sources, a large share of European internet users claim not to know where 
to find reliable diet related information. Therefore, policy makers, health promoters and health educators in every country 
should aim to create high quality, easy to find nutrition sites. It is also crucial that such sites appear high on the list 
of search engine results. If such sources exist, easy to find and use directories should help internet users find them. 
The less educated, poor and unhealthy consumers are less familiar with sources of nutrition information and rarely attempt 
to seek it.  These groups should be a primary target for intensified nutrition information education within and apart from 
informational and educational campaigns aimed at improving eating habits. </p>

<p>Nutrition information literacy is strongly affected by the local environment. There are large differences between European 
citizens in respect to the claimed knowledge of nutrition information sources, frequency of information seeking and information 
sources used. Probable causes are differences in availability of good quality nutrition information sources, and differences 
in citizens' nutrition information literacy. The reasons and barriers in finding useful and reliable information should be 
investigated in each country, and efforts should be made to level the accessibility and quality of healthy diet information 
across Europe.  </p>
