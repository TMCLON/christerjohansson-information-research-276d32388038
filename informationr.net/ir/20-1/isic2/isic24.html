 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 
<p>Recent socio-technological development has opened up a wide
range of channels for information seeking and sharing. Social media
platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, for example, are popular among
younger generations (<a href="isic24.html#dug13">Duggan and
Brenner, 2013</a>). As social media become increasingly popular,
a number of studies have been conducted to examine college students'
social media use (<a href="isic24.html#cor10">Correa <em></em>, 2010</a>;
<a href="isic24.html#gra13">Gray <em></em>, 2013</a>; <a href="isic24.html#hug12">Hughes <em></em>, 2012</a>; <a href="isic24.html#yan13">Yang and Brown, 2013</a>). Most of
those studies, however, investigated social media use for socialization
or marketing purposes (<a href="isic24.html#ber12">Berthon <em></em>,
2012</a>; <a href="isic24.html#ell07">Ellison <em></em>, 2007</a>)
rather than for information seeking. The latter is a promising area for
information behaviour and information literacy research, as there is
beginning evidence that individuals often turn to social media for
finding information. About 50% of online teens and over 80% of college
students use social media for their academic as well as everyday life
research, for example (<a href="isic24.html#hea09">Head and Eisenberg, 2009</a>,
<a href="isic24.html#hea10">2010</a>; <a href="isic24.html#pew12">Pew,
2012</a>). Given the popularity of these platforms, it is
important to understand what individuals do when using social media for
information seeking, and what affects such behaviour. </p>

<p>While specific platforms, particularly Wikipedia, have
received more attention in information behaviour research, there is a
dearth of studies comparing individuals' information use and evaluation
across different social media platforms and contexts. Furthermore,
little research has been done on user variables
that influence the social media use for information seeking. Previous
studies suggest that sex is one of the user variables significantly
affecting the use of social networking sites and Wikipedia (<a href="isic24.html#nad12">Nadkarni and Hofmann, 2012</a>; <a href="isic24.html#lin11">Lin and Lu, 2011</a>; <a href="isic24.html#lim10">Lim and Kwon, 2010</a>).
Problem-solving style is another variable with potential influence on
social media use as it has been found to affect Web search behaviour
and source selection (<a href="isic24.html#kim08">Kim, 2008</a>;
<a href="isic24.html#wil12">Williams and Kim, 2012</a>).</p>

<p>Focusing on undergraduate students, this study aims to
investigate the use and evaluation of social media for
information-seeking purposes in two contexts, academic and everyday
life. Of particular interest are individual differences in such
behaviour. The study examines how users' sex and problem-solving
styles influence the social media use and evaluation in these contexts.
Findings of the study will help better understand how user and
contextual factors influence the use of social media as information
sources.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Social media use for information acquisition</h3>

<p>Social media are widely popular across different age groups.
Social networking sites like Facebook, for example, are among the most
popular social media platforms used by college students (<a href="isic24.html#smi11">Smith, Rainie,
and Zickuhr, 2011</a>). Although the main purpose of using
social
networking sites is related to socialization, an increasing number of
individuals seem to get news from social networking sites.
Media-sharing sites such as YouTube are also known as important sources
for news (<a href="isic24.html#pew12">Pew, 2012</a>). More
recently, microblogs like Twitter are found
to be used for getting news as well (<a href="isic24.html#mit13">Mitchell,
Holcomb, and Page,
2013</a>). Wikipedia has been known as another popular social
media
platform, which is often used as a starting point. A great number of
students would begin with Wikipedia when searching for information,
because it often provides an overview of a new concept and also useful
resources (<a href="isic24.html#hea10">Head and Eisenberg, 2010</a>).
</p>

<h3>Sex and information behaviour</h3>

<p>The sex of users seems to have some effects on the online information
behaviour. In general, male students tend to use internet sources more
frequently than females (<a href="isic24.html#li07">Li and
Kirkup, 2007</a>). The former use the Internet for a variety of
leisure activities and news information whereas the latter use it for
communication and academic purposes (<a href="isic24.html#fal05">Fallows,
2005</a>; <a href="isic24.html#jon09">Jones <em></em>, 2009</a>).
Regarding social media use, social networking sites seem to be used by
female rather than male students (<a href="isic24.html#mad11">Madden
and Zickuhr, 2011</a>; <a href="isic24.html#nad12">Nadkarni
and Hofmann, 2012</a>). On such sites, female students are
also likely to spend more time (<a href="isic24.html#moo12">Moore
and McElroy, 2012</a>) and have more friends (<a href="isic24.html#pem09">Pempek <em></em>, 2009</a>). Compared to
their counterparts, male students tend to use social networking sites
more for task-oriented reasons and less for interpersonal purposes (<a href="isic24.html#lin11">Lin and Lu, 2011</a>). Research
suggests that the topics in which each sex group is engaged are
related to stereotypical sex roles (<a href="isic24.html#har06">Harp
and Tremayne, 2006</a>; <a href="isic24.html#kno07">Knobloch-Westerwick
and Alter, 2007</a>). Regarding the online shopping
behaviour, friends seem to have more impact among female shoppers than
males (<a href="isic24.html#gar04">Garbarino and Strahilevitz,
2004</a>; <a href="isic24.html#kim07">Kim <em>et
al.</em>, 2007</a>).</p>

<h3>Problem-solving style and information behaviour</h3>

<p> A problem-solving process, defined as a goal-oriented
sequence of cognitive operations (<a href="isic24.html#and80">Anderson,
1980</a>), involves both cognition and emotion, and is manifested through behaviour. According
to Zamble and Gekoski (<a href="isic24.html#zam94">1994</a>),
individuals with emotion-focused approaches tend to make themselves feel better about a problematic
situation without changing the problem itself whereas those with
problem-focused approaches actually make changes on the problematic
situation in order to make it less stressful. Heppner (<a href="isic24.html#hep88">1988</a>) developed
an instrument called Problem Solving Inventory (problem solving inventory) to determine
problem-solving styles by measuring self-perceived problem-solving
ability. It consists of three scales derived from factor analysis:
problem-solving confidence, approach-avoidance style, and personal
control. </p>

<p> A study on source selection shows that individuals who are
emotion-focused, avoiding rather than approaching problem-solving
activities, tend to use online resources more than traditional library
resources (<a href="isic24.html#wil12">Williams and Kim, 2012</a>). This result elaborates the
personality of avoiders who prefer using online resources that are
easily accessible than going through the process of searching for print
resources (<a href="isic24.html#mil83">Miller and Mangan 1983</a>).
Another study reveals that individuals with low level of personal control become emotional when
solving a less structured problem and become less effective in online
information seeking (<a href="isic24.html#kim08">Kim, 2008</a>).</p>

<h3> Contexts and information behaviour</h3>

<p> To understand human information behaviour, it is important to know the context of information behaviour as well as humans themselves (<a href="isic24.html#fis09">Fisher and Julien, 2009</a>; <a href="isic24.html#all01">Allen and Kim, 2001</a>). While contexts can be conceptualised in different levels and from different angles (<a href="isic24.html#cou07">Courtright, 2007</a>; <a href="isic24.html#joh03">Johnson, 2003</a>), most research on information behaviour has been in academic research or work-related contexts (<a href="isic24.html#kuh91">Kuhlthau, 1991</a>; <a href="isic24.html#fid99">Fidel <em></em>, 1999</a>; <a href="isic24.html#mck07">McKnight, 2007</a>; <a href="isic24.html#mac05">MacIntosh-Murray and Choo, 2005</a>), as improving users' performance in such contexts is considered crucial. Interest in information behaviour in everyday life contexts, however, has continued to grow (<a href="isic24.html#fis09">Fisher and Julien, 2009</a>) and more research has focused on information behaviour in everyday contexts (<a href="isic24.html#ago05">Agosto and Hughes-Hassell, 2005</a>; <a href="isic24.html#gra05">Gray, Klein, Noyce, Sesselberg, and Cantrill, 2005</a>; <a href="isic24.html#sav07">Savolainen, 2007</a>, <a href="isic24.html#sav08">2008</a>).</p>

<p> Although a number of studies have been conducted focusing on
the use of social media, there is a dearth of research on social media
use as information sources. Furthermore, little attention has been paid
to factors affecting social media use. The study aims to investigate
individual differences in social media use and evaluation in two
information-seeking contexts. Its research questions include: (1) how
individuals with different sex and problem-solving style use social
media in the academic and the everyday-life contexts, and (2) how
individuals with different sex and problem-solving style evaluate
information from social media in the academic and the everyday-life
contexts. </p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>To find out how undergraduates use social media for
information seeking purposes, data were collected using a Web survey.
The survey questionnaire was developed through three steps. First,
students and librarians with substantial experience with social media
were involved in developing a list of strategies and data elements used
for evaluating information from social media. Second, based on the list
developed in step 1 and also questions used in our previous study on
social media, a questionnaire was developed and implemented using
Qualtrics (<a href="http://www.qualtrics.com">www.qualtrics.com</a>).
The survey questionnaire was finalised after two rounds of pilot testing. Pilot-test participants were
students recruited from different graduate and undergraduate classes.
In addition, the problem solving inventory (problem solving inventory: <a href="isic24.html#hep88">Heppner,
1988</a>) was used to assess participants' perception of their own problem-solving behaviours
and attitudes in general. problem solving inventory is a standardised test, consisting of 35
items rated on a 6-point scale. The total score is considered to be the
best overall index of one's self-perceived problem-solving ability -
effectiveness of one's problem solving. Its reliability indicating the
internal consistency ranged from 0.72 to 0.91, while its test-retest
reliability ranged from 0.81 to 0.89. </p>

<p>A call for participation was distributed to all the
undergraduate students (N = 26,528) in a public university in the
United States. Participation was voluntary. To increase the response
rate, a bookstore gift card was offered to those selected via a random
drawing. Participants interested in entering the drawing pool were
asked to provide their e-mail addresses upon the completion of the
survey. </p>

<h3>Data analysis</h3>

<p>Two-way ANOVAs were used to test the effects of sex and
problem-solving style on the frequency of using social media and the
evaluation of information from social media. The analyses were done
using SPSS. </p>

<h3>Participants </h3>

<p>A total of 1,355 responses were received: the response rate
was around 5%. About 60% of the respondents were female and 40% were
male. A majority of the respondents (67%) were between 20 and 24 years
old. Thirty-one percent of them were under 20 years old. In terms of
their academic major, most of the respondents were in science and
engineering (39%), followed by social sciences (37%), and arts
&amp; humanities (11%). The mean problem solving inventory score of the sample was 86.50,
with a standard deviation of 19.38. Using the sample mean, respondents'
problem-solving styles were categorised into two groups: effective and
ineffective. Low problem solving inventory scores signify better problem solving. Respondents
with low problem solving inventory scores are referred to as the effective problem-solving
group while those with high problem solving inventory scores as ineffective problem-solving
group. About 47.4% of female and 49.1% of male respondents belonged to
the effective problem-solving group. </p>

<h3>Limitations </h3>

<p>As the non-probability convenience sampling method was used in
this study and the response rate was low, any generalization of the
study's findings should be done with caution. </p>

<h2>Findings </h2>

<h3>Research question 1: social media used for information seeking</h3>

<p>Respondents rated how often they used different social media
platforms as information sources for academic and everyday information
seeking. The answers ranged from 1 to 5, with 5 indicating "almost
always." The top five platforms in the academic context were: wikis (<em>M
= </em>3.58), Q&amp;A sites (<em>M = </em>2.43),
media-sharing services (<em>M = </em>2.24), internet
forums (<em>M =</em> 1.73), and blogs (<em>M =</em>
1.57). The top five platforms in the everyday context were: social
networking sites (<em>M</em> = 3.88), media-sharing
services (<em>M</em> = 3.56), wikis (<em>M </em>=
3.31), user reviews (<em>M =</em> 2.81), and microblogs (<em>M
=</em> 2.77). These top five platforms in both contexts yielded a
total of eight unique platforms: wikis, social networking sites,
media-sharing services, user reviews, Q&amp;A sites, blogs,
microblogs, and internet forums. These platforms are used for the
subsequent analyses. Figure 1 shows the frequency of information
seeking via the eight platforms by context and sex. Overall,
respondents used social media for information seeking in everyday
contexts (<em>M =</em> 2.86) more frequently than in
academic contexts (<em>M = </em>1.98). </p>

<figcaption>Figure 1: Frequency of using social media for
information seeking,&nbsp;by context and sex</figcaption></figure>

<h4>Academic context: sex and problem-solving style differences </h4>
<p>Eight 2x2 ANOVAs were conducted, one for each social media
platform. Figure 4 summarises the results. Out of the eight platforms
tested, sex effects were found in three platforms: wikis, blogs, and
internet forums. Male respondents used each of the three platforms more
frequently than females did: Wikis: <em>Mean<sub>Male</sub></em>
= 3.74, <em>Mean<sub>Female</sub></em> = 3.47 (<em>p</em>
&lt; 0.001); Blogs: <em>Mean<sub>Male</sub></em>
= 1.64, <em>Mean<sub>Female</sub></em> = 1.52 (<em>p</em>
&lt; 0.05); and Internet forums: &nbsp;<em>Mean<sub>Male</sub></em>
= 1.89, <em>Mean<sub>Female</sub></em> = 1.63 (<em>p</em>
&lt;0.001). A significant effect of problem-solving style was also
found in four platforms: social networking sites, user reviews, blogs
and microblogs. Respondents with ineffective problem-solving style
used these four platforms more frequently than those with effective
style: Social networking sites: &nbsp;<em>Mean<sub>Effective
 problem-solving</sub></em> = 1.42, <em>Mean<sub>Ineffective
 problem-solving</sub></em>
= 1.56 (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.01); User reviews: <em>Mean<sub>
Effective problem-solving</sub></em> = 1.38, <em>Mean<sub>Ineffective problem-solving</sub></em>
= 1.54 (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001); Blogs: <em>Mean<sub>
Effective problem-solving</sub></em> = 1.51, <em>Mean<sub>Ineffective
 problem-solving</sub></em> = 1.64 (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.01);
and
Microblogs: <em>Mean<sub> Effective problem-solving</sub></em>
= 1.27, <em>Mean<sub>Ineffective problem-solving</sub></em>
=
1.45 (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). Two platforms showed
significant sex and problem-solving style interaction effects:
social networking sites (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.01) and
microblogs (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.01). The interaction
patterns seem to be similar (Figures 2 and 3). For both platforms,
women showed similar level of social networking sites and microblogging
use, regardless of their problem-solving styles. Men, in contrast,
showed pronounced differences based on problem-solving style. Male
respondents with effective problem-solving style used these two
platforms rather sparingly while ineffective problem solvers used the
platforms frequently.</p>

<figure class="centre"> <img src="isic24fig3.jpg" alt="Figure3" /><figcaption>Figure 3: Sex and problem-solving style interaction: use of microblogs in academic context</figcaption></figure>


<h4>Everyday context: sex and problem-solving style differences </h4>

<p>The results of the eight 2x2 ANOVAs in the everyday context
differ from the findings for the academic context (Figure 4). Here, out
of the eight platforms, a significant sex effect was found in four
platforms while a significant effect of problem-solving style was found
in one platform only. No interaction effect was found. Significant
sex effects were found in wikis, social networking sites,
microblogs, and internet forums. In the everyday context, male
respondents used wikis and internet forums more frequently than females
did: Wikis: <em>Mean<sub>Male</sub></em> = 3.63, <em>Mean<sub>Female</sub></em> = 3.11 (<em>p</em>
&lt; 0.001); Internet forums: <em>Mean<sub>Male</sub></em>
= 2.35, <em>Mean<sub>Female</sub></em> = 1.78 (<em>p</em>
&lt; 0.001). In contrast, female respondents used social networking
sites and microblogs more frequently than males: Social networking
sites: <em>Mean<sub>Male</sub></em> = 3.63, <em>Mean<sub>Female</sub></em>
= 4.01 (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001); Microblogs: <em>Mean<sub>Male</sub></em>
= 2.47, <em>Mean<sub>Female</sub></em> = 2.97 (<em>p</em>
&lt; 0.001). In terms of problem solving inventory, respondents with ineffective
problem-solving style tended to use internet forums more frequently
than those with effective problem-solving style: <em>Mean<sub>Effective
 problem-solving</sub></em> = 1.99, <em>Mean<sub>Ineffective
 problem-solving</sub></em> = 2.12, (<em>p</em>
&lt; 0.05). </p>

media: a summary [Note: Shaded area indicates statistically significant differences (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05). <br />Notation in the shaded box shows the user group with higher frequency
of use.] </figcaption></figure>

<h3>Research question 2: frequency of taking evaluative actions </h3>
<p>Respondents rated how frequently they took different actions
for evaluating information from social media. The answer scale ranged
from 1 to 5, with 5 indicating "almost always." Averaging across the
eight social media platforms, the top five evaluative actions in the
academic context were: Compare the content with external/official
sources (<em>M</em> = 2.51), Check the posting date (<em>M</em>
= 2.47), Check tone/style of writing/argument (<em>M</em> =
2.38), Check the length of the article/posting (<em>M</em>
= 2.37), and Check other users' reactions to a posting (<em>M</em>
= 2.37). In the everyday context, the top five actions were different:
Check other user's reactions to a posting (<em>M</em> =
2.73), Check the posting date (<em>M</em> = 2.67), Check
tone/style of writing/argument (<em>M</em> = 2.49), Check
quality of images/graphs/sounds (<em>M</em> = 2.49) and
Check the length of the article/posting (<em>M</em> =
2.40). These top five evaluative actions for the academic and everyday
contexts yielded six unique evaluative actions and they are included
for the subsequent analyses. The frequency of taking evaluative actions
by context and sex is shown in Figure 5. Overall, respondents
evaluated the social media information only occasionally. On average,
they took evaluative actions slightly more frequently in the everyday
context (<em>M</em> = 2.53) than in the academic context (<em>M</em>
= 2.41). </p>

<figure class="centre"> <img src="isic24fig5.jpg" alt="Figure5" /><figcaption>Figure 5: Frequency of taking evaluative actions, by context and sex</figcaption></figure>

<h4>Academic context: sex and problem-solving style differences.</h4>

<p>Six 2x2 ANOVAs were conducted on how frequently respondents
took specific evaluative actions when using information from social
media in the academic context. No significant sex effect was found.
A significant effect of problem-solving style was found in one
strategy: Compare the content with external/official sources.
Respondents with effective problem-solving style used this strategy
more often than those with ineffective problem-solving: <em>Mean<sub>Effective
 problem-solving</sub></em> = 2.57, <em>Mean<sub>Ineffective
 problem-solving</sub></em>= 2.45 (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05). One evaluative strategy -
Check other users' reactions to a posting - showed a significant
interaction effect between sex and problem-solving style (<em>p</em>
&lt; 0.05). Female respondents with effective problem-solving style
checked other users' reactions more frequently than those with
ineffective style did. The pattern for male students was reverse: those
with ineffective problem-solving style checked others' responses more
frequently than those with effective style (Figure 6). </p>

<h4>Everyday context: sex and problem-solving style differences </h4>

<p>The six ANOVA results in the everyday context again differ
from those in the academic context (Figure 7). Compared to the academic
context where no significant sex difference was found, sex had
significant effects on two evaluative actions in the everyday life
context: Check tone/style of writing/argument: <em>Mean<sub>Male</sub></em>
= 2.58, <em>Mean<sub>Female</sub></em> = 2.45 (<em>p</em>
&lt; 0.05) and Compare the content with external/official sources: <em>Mean<sub>Male</sub></em>
= 2.50, <em>Mean<sub>Female</sub></em> = 2.31 (<em>p</em>
&lt; .01). Male respondents used these two strategies more
frequently. In terms of problem solving inventory, the results were particularly notable:
significant effects of problem-solving style were found in all six
strategies. It was always those with effective problem-solving style
who took the evaluative actions more frequently. No interaction effect
was found.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The principle of least effort is commonly observed in human information behaviour (<a href="isic24.html#cas05">Case, 2005</a>).
Individuals often turn to familiar information sources and behaviour, even when
those sources might not be the most suitable for a specific task or
context. This is common among students. For example, students often
turn to general Web resources, even when they are conducting academic
tasks (<a href="isic24.html#geo06">George
<em></em>, 2006</a>; <a href="isic24.html#kim11">Kim and
Sin, 2011</a>; <a href="isic24.html#lee12">Lee, Paik,
and Joo, 2012</a>). Interestingly, the current study shows
that context makes a difference in students' social media use and
evaluation. Individuals used social media as information sources in the
everyday context more often than in the academic context; and they took
evaluative actions more frequently in the former than in the latter.
This affirms the value of contextual analysis in the research of social
media information behaviour. Studies will yield richer data and
insights when questions specific to contexts and platforms are
explored. </p>

<p>The differing results between academic and everyday contexts
in evaluative actions are worth mentioning. There were only two
significant effects in the academic context, while eight in the
everyday context. It is speculated that information literacy training
makes a difference. Through their training, students are likely to be
aware of the types of criteria and general strategies for evaluating
information in academic contexts. This training may have contributed to
more consistent evaluative behaviours and reduced the extent of
individual differences. In contrast, there is less information literacy
training specifically focused on everyday life information seeking.
This may leave everyday information seeking behaviour more prone to
individual differences. Another possible explanation is related to the
diversity of problems in the everyday context. Compared to the academic
context where typical tasks requiring information search exist (e.g.,
research paper), tasks in the everyday context may vary widely (e.g.,
online shopping, celebrity search, social networking). A study
investigating social media information behaviours for specific tasks
carried out in the academic and everyday contexts may help elicit more
in-depth and precise findings on evaluative behaviours. </p>
<p> It is notable that significant effects of problem-solving
style were found in all six evaluative actions in the everyday context,
where respondents with effective problem-solving style conducted more
evaluations. Overall, respondents made only average level of evaluative
efforts in both the academic (<em>M</em> = 2.41) and
everyday contexts (<em>M</em> = 2.53). Given that the
quality of information from social media has been of a concern (<a href="isic24.html#kar13">Karlova
and Fisher, 2013</a>;<a href="isic24.html#kim14"> Kim,
Sin and Yoo-Lee, 2014</a>),
this medium level of evaluative efforts may suggest a need for
intervention.</p>

<p> Interestingly, male respondents were found to use two of the
evaluative actions more often than females in the everyday context.
This, at first sight, differs from the view of the selectivity model in
which women are considered to be more comprehensive information
processors who would take more information cues, including incongruent
cues, into account. On the other hand, men are viewed as more heuristic
in their approach and use fewer cues for information processing and
decision making (<a href="isic24.html#ben00">Benyamini, Leventhal,
and Leventhal, 2000</a>; <a href="isic24.html#chu98">Chung
and Monroe, 1998</a>;<a href="isic24.html#dar95"> Darley
and Smith, 1995</a>; <a href="isic24.html#mey91">Meyers-Levy
and
Maheswaran, 1991</a>; <a href="isic24.html#meyste91">Meyers-Levy
and
Sternthal, 1991</a>;<a href="isic24.html#odo01"> O'Donnell
and Johnson,
2001</a>). The difference between the model and the study
finding may be attributed to the problem-solving style introduced and
controlled in the current study. That is, some of the previous
discussion on sex and information processing may in part be
confounded by the relationship between information processing and
problem solving styles. An alternative explanation may be related to
the type of tasks that male students are typically engaged in the
everyday context and the purpose of such typical tasks. Male students
seem to be task-oriented: they tend to use social networking sites more
for task-oriented reasons rather than interpersonal purposes, for
example (<a href="isic24.html#lin11">Lin and Lu, 2011</a>).
To test this, it will be helpful to
conduct a study where evaluative actions are examined for various types
of tasks that are typically carried out in the everyday context. In
such a study, effects of sex, problem-solving style and the context
may be more easily and accurately tested.</p>
<p> This divergent evaluative behaviour in the everyday context
prompts the question whether individuals taking different evaluative
actions are similarly effective in obtaining quality information to
meet their everyday needs. Future study may test the outcome of social
media information seeking, such as the resolution of one's information
needs and one's quality of life. This can help detect potential
individual differences in information barriers and inform the
development of suitable intervention strategies. </p>
<p> The study also found significant sex differences. Worth
noting here is that the current study used multivariate analyses - even
after individuals' cognitive and affective approaches to problem
solving have been taken into account, sex differences remain
significant. As physical access to information and communication
technologies has improved over the years, especially among younger
generations, the sex gap is viewed as less of a concern (<a href="isic24.html#wei00">Weiser,
2000</a>). The current study, however, corroborates findings of
extant research on specific platforms, such as in the use of Wikipedia
(<a href="isic24.html#lim10">Lim
and Kwon, 2010</a>) and the information sharing through
blogs (<a href="isic24.html#lu10">Lu,
Lin, Hsiao and Cheng, 2010</a>), that sex differences
in information behaviour remain salient. For example, findings of
the current study suggest that females value social aspects of social
media sources more than males when using social media for information
seeking in the everyday context. As such, sex should still be a
factor under investigation in information behaviour research. However,
it may be more fruitful if the sex effect is studied in relation to
the specific types of tasks carried out under each of academic and
everyday contexts, because this could help tease out effects of sex
and context more accurately. </p>

<p> The significant interaction between sex and
problem-solving style is worth highlighting, as it is rarely examined.
Significant interactions were found in the use of social networking
sites and microblogs in the academic context. Most surveys found that a
larger share of women than men used social networking sites and
microblogs (<a href="isic24.html#bee12">Beevolve,
2012</a>; <a href="isic24.html#dug14">Duggan
and Smith, 2014</a>). These studies, however, are not
specifically on the use of social media for information seeking
purposes. Because the current study specifically asked about social
media uses for information seeking in different contexts, it was able
to show different and more nuanced findings. Female respondents used
these two platforms more frequently than males only in the everyday
context, but not so in the academic context. It was actually male
respondents with ineffective problem-solving style, who used social
networking sites and microblogs more frequently in the academic
context. From the angle of information literacy education, social
networking sites and microblogs do not appear to be particularly
suitable channels for academic tasks. Information literacy
professionals may want to identify and address potential issues in
social media information seeking in this user group. </p>

<p> On a conceptual level, the interaction between sex and
problem-solving style found on the evaluative action, '<em>Check other
users' reactions</em>'. is intriguing (Figure 5). More research is needed to
uncover the mechanism behind this pattern. One angle is to draw from
the social cognitive theory and the sex role theory. Both suggest
that through learning, socialization, incentive motivation, and
incentive structure in one's environment, individuals learn what is
considered sex-normative behaviour in one's society, which can
influence one's behaviour (<a href="isic24.html#bus99">Bussey and Bandura, 1999</a>;
<a href="isic24.html#eag91">Eagly
and Wood, 1991</a>). A common theme in information
technology usage research seems to be that sex differences largely
conform to prevailing sex norms. Men's internet use is considered
more agentic and instrumental, whereas women's usage is more communal
and communicative (<a href="isic24.html#lin11">Lin
and Lu, 2011</a>; <a href="isic24.html#mus12">Muscanell and Guadagno,
2012</a>; <a href="isic24.html#she08">Sheldon,
2008</a>; <a href="isic24.html#ven00">Venkatesh
and Morris, 2000</a>). It is thus interesting that female
respondents with effective problem solving style favoured checking
other users' reactions, a seemingly social strategy; whereas male
respondents with effective problem-solving style were less involved in
such socially-oriented actions. This suggests that perceived sex
norms, problem-solving approaches, and information behaviours may be
interrelated. It may be that individuals with effective problem-solving
style, armed with higher emotional and behavioural control, may select
strategies that are congruent with prevailing sex norms. Perhaps
they may choose these strategies even when, at the personal level, the
strategies are not one's preference or favourite. As from an
utilitarian angle, strategies fitting prevailing norms are likely to be
endorsed by the society at large, which will reduce one's needs for
efforts in overcoming societal resistance, and allow the individual to
focus his/her energy on the problem at hand. Certainly, more research
is needed to explore this proposition. Regardless of the specific
mechanism behind this interaction, the role of social learning and
perceived norms in information behaviour is a fascinating area to
explore.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>Conclusion </h2>
<p>The study findings suggest significant impacts of the context
on the use and evaluation of social media platforms. The study also
reveals interesting interactions between sex and problem-solving
style in the academic context. That is, among female respondents, the
effectiveness of their problem-solving style does not affect the use of
social networking sites and microblogs whereas among male respondents,
those with ineffective problem-solving style used social networking
sites and microblogs more often than those with effective
problem-solving style. Interestingly, females with effective
problem-solving style checked other users' reactions more often than
those with ineffective problem-solving style. In the everyday context,
main effects of sex and problem-solving styles are found but not
their interaction effects.</p>
<p>The study supports that the context is again an important
factor to
consider in social media studies as it influences the behaviour of
using and evaluating social media as information sources. In academic
contexts, tasks tend to be better defined and individuals often apply a
set of strategies they have learned through information literacy
training. In everyday life contexts, on the other hand, tasks are less
clear, and users seem to rely on their own preferences, which results
in more individual differences in information behaviour. A future
study, to help tease out effects of user and context variables more
efficiently, might examine behaviour in the use of social media for a
set of typical tasks in the everyday context.</p>
<p> Regarding user factors, both sex and problem-solving style
seem to affect the information seeking through social media. The
interaction between sex and problem-solving style found on
evaluative strategies is especially interesting. The findings could not
be fully explained by sex and problem-solving styles only. It seems
to suggest that other actors such as sociocultural factors may have
intervened and influenced the social media information behaviour. It
has been pinpointed that sex seldom receives central attention in
information behaviour research (<a href="isic24.html#for01">Ford,
Miller, and Moss,
2001</a>;
<a href="isic24.html#hup06">Hupfer
and Detlor, 2006</a>; <a href="isic24.html#urq10">Urquhart and Yeoman, 2010</a>).
Of special interest to future research is to discover the factors and
mechanisms that contribute to sex differences. In light of this
research gap, the authors of this paper propose that a series of
research can be developed to pair sex with other factors as
explanatory factors of information behaviour. For example, researchers
may test effects of sex and information seeking motivations on
information behaviour, or effects of sex and perceived sex norms
as suggested by sex role theory. There are a variety of perspectives
concerning the sources of sex differences, among them: biological
approach; sociocultural approach that focuses on macro-structure such
as the division of labour; sociocultural approach that focuses on
micro-structure such as social role theory and symbolic-interactionism;
psychological approach that includes behavioural, cognitive, or social
cognitive perspectives; or combinations of the above (<a href="isic24.html#bus99">Bussey
and Bandura, 1999</a>; <a href="isic24.html#cha99">Chafetz, 1999</a>). Factors
may be derived from these perspectives to be empirically tested with
sex as explanatory variables of information behaviour. Such
multivariate analyses will begin to shed light on whether sex
moderates the influence and the direction of such influence that other
individual and social factors have on information behaviour; and what
factors mediate and explain the relationship between sex and
information behaviour. </p>
