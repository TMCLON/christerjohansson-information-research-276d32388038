 <h2>Introduction</h2> 

 <p>Recently, the widespread use of digital information and communication
technologies has generated an unprecedented amount of Web content through
Weblogs, wikis and other social tools. The Web 2.0 technologies have enabled
collaborative approaches to different endeavours, such as 'folksonomies' and
social tagging.  The last few years have seen the rise of these technologies and
the research focusing on them. </p>

 <p> 'Folksonomies' are a user-centred technique for knowledge organization.
The term was originally coined by Thomas Van Der Wal; it is a portmanteau of the
two words 'folks' and 'taxonomy' (<a href="paper482#van07">Vander Wal 2007</a>).
Several social bookmarking services are available on the Web to build these
folksonomies. The more popular amongst these are <em><a
href="http://www.delicious.com/" target="_blank">delicious.com</a></em>,  in
which users bookmark and tag Web pages;  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/"
target="_blank">Flickr</a>, where photographs and short videos can be uploaded
and tagged by users;  <a href="http://www.connotea.org/"
target="_blank">Connotea</a> and <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/home"
target="_blank">CiteULike</a> which are services for scholarly articles and
Websites; and <a href="http://www.librarything.com/"
target="_blank">LibraryThing</a>, where the users can catalogue  and tag both
personal book collections and those within a library.  The users are
categorizing their own and others' collections and building bottom-up
classification systems.  Today, users are organizing their own digital
collections by adding metadata. </p>

 <p> Two approaches to organizing and providing access to resources and for
building vocabulary tools are discussed in the literature: the bottom-up and the
top-down approach.  The top-down approach envisages first creating a structure
and the control of the terminology. The traditional classification systems, such
as Dewey Decimal and Library of Congress, thesauri and other controlled
vocabulary tools adopt this approach.  The bottom-up approach begins at the
grassroots and the social tagging systems offer a platform for this
collaborative effort.  The advantage of this method is that it aggregates the
opinions of many, and is more likely to provide users with what they want than a
top-down method.   </p>

 <p> While the information profession has long employed controlled vocabularies
to provide access to information resources, user tagging and folksonomies are
recent approaches.  Contrary to a folksonomy, a controlled vocabulary is an
established list of standardized terminology intended to be used in the
indexing, organization and retrieval of information. The National Institute of
Health defines controlled vocabulary as '<em>system of terms involving e.g.
definitions, hierarchical structure, and cross-references that is used to index
and retrieve a body of literature in bibliographic, factual, or other
databases</em>' (<a href="paper482#nat04">National Institutes of Health 2004</a>). A
subject heading list is one kind of controlled vocabulary that is used; the
<em>Library of Congress Subject Headings</em> and the <em>Medical Subject
Headings</em> are examples of such lists.  This contrasts with natural language
terms where no restrictions are imposed.  Social tagging allows users to employ
natural language as metadata, and this freedom results in the use of multiple
terms that represent the same concept in many different ways.  While controlled
vocabularies reduce the ambiguity inherent in natural languages, they are also
not without problems.  Using the same terminology throughout a database ensures
consistency and precision and helps the user find relevant information. The
disadvantage is the rigidity of the approach, which may not represent the
multiple viewpoints of users. </p>

 <h2>Literature Review</h2>

 <p> Both controlled vocabularies and folksonomies are tools that aid the user
in search and retrieval, but the sources of vocabularies are very different. The
pros and cons of controlled vocabularies and folksonomies are discussed
extensively in the literature and only a brief summation is presented.
Folksonomies are low-cost, inclusive and current.  They are not restricted to
binary relationships and also encourage users to interact more with the
material.  They help to build communities of users with common interests and
goals (<a href="paper482#mat04">Mathes 2004</a>; <a href="paper482#kro05">Kroski 2005</a>).  The
users are motivated to contribute to the community; the knowledge bases
constructed by the masses are the impetus for their contributions.  However, not
all users are aware of the social impact of their contributions; they tag items
to meet their own needs and their contributions can actually undermine the
constructed knowledge base as a whole (<a href="paper482#mar06">Marlow <em>et al.</em>
2006</a>).  In addition, folksonomies lack terminological precision.  As such,
searches often result in low precision and low recall.  The lack of synonym
control and the presence of meaningless terms also complicate the search and
retrieval process.  At the organizational level they are essentially flat,
non-hierarchical structures,  which can create semantic ambiguity and confusion
(<a href="paper482#mer04">Merholz 2004</a>; <a href="paper482#shi05">Shirky 2005</a>).  As a
filtering or searching device these issues present difficulties for users. </p>

 <p> Heckner <em>et al.</em> tested the tag usage in <em>Connotea</em> using a
category model for linguistic and functional aspects of tag usage as well as to
determine the relationship between tags and the document text. One of the
outcomes of the study indicated that 46% of the tags were not found in the
document.  '<em>This shows that users' tags considerably add to the lexical
space of the tagged resource</em>' (<a href="paper482#hec07">Heckner <em>et al.</em>
2007</a>). Their research indicated that in an academic resource there were more
general tags and few non-content related tags when compared to Websites such as

<em>Flickr</em> and <em>Delicious</em>. </p>

 <p> Controlled vocabularies, on the other hand, through the process of
controlling synonyms and homonyms and embedding mandated terms in their semantic
context (through the broader, narrower and related terms) create a navigable
structure that can increase recall and precision when users perform searches.
However, the controlled vocabularies use a formal, standardised form of natural
language and it may be difficult for searchers to learn and use this terminology
to their best advantage.  Despite these differences, both controlled
vocabularies and social tagging have much to offer to the study of information
access. </p>

 <h3>Relationship between  folksonomies and controlled vocabularies</h3>

 <p> Chan (<a href="paper482#cha09">2009</a>) suggests that both subject indexing and
social tagging are two different approaches for information storage and
retrieval and recognizes the potential for social tags to enhance both the
controlled vocabularies and subject access.  This enrichment occurs because the
social tags provide an understanding of user perspective and searching behaviour
as well as provide a source for adding terms to controlled vocabularies. In
addition, librarians have also used folksonomies in bibliographic instruction to
teach users the benefits of controlled vocabularies and their structures (<a
href="paper482#mag09">Maggio et. al. 2009</a>).  To leverage the benefits of each
system, efforts are being made to explore methods of combining folksonomy tags
with theories from knowledge organization systems.</p>   

 <blockquote>Much current research is focused on mechanisms by which tags can
be improved and more useful formal semantics can be derived from simple
community tagging systems – that is, how ontologies can be derived from
folksonomies.  The aim is to optimize the trade-off between the simplicity and
freedom of community tagging and the benefits to search engines of hierarchical
structured vocabularies' (<a href="paper482#shi05">Shirky 2005</a>).</blockquote>  

 <p>In order to fully utilize both of the approaches, the user tags that are
generated from these tagging systems need to be organized in some meaningful
fashion. </p>

 <p> One approach to the establishment of meaningful structures is by
examining the types of semantic relationships between concepts.  Kipp (<a
href="paper482#kip06">2006</a>) suggests that the relationship among tags can be defined
as associative relationships, but that these relationships among tags are
'<em>valuable sources for more fine-grained semantic relations in both
folksonomies and KOS</em>' [knowledge organization systems] (Peters and Waller . -->  Several
studies have examined the typology of semantic relations that exist between
concepts in specific domains, though not in the context of social tagging.  Bean
and Green (<a href="paper482#bea01">2001</a>) present types of relationships in various
thesauri, classification schemes and relationships among knowledge structures.
Neelameghan (<a href="paper482#nee01">2001</a>) identifies lateral relationships in
multicultural and multilingual databases in the spiritual and religious domains.
A larger and more comprehensive inventory of subject relationships is presented
in the Appendix of the <em>Final report</em> of the Subcommittee on Subject
Relationships/Reference Structures to the Subject Analysis Committee of the
Association for Library Collections and Technical Services, Cataloging &amp;
Classification Section (<a href="paper482#mic96">Michel 1996</a>). </p>

 <p> An article by Peters and Weller (<a href="paper482#pet08">2008</a>) gives an
overview of different approaches to re-organizing and editing tags.
'<em>Fertilizing folksonomies with existing KOS is a promising approach to
enable semantic enrichment</em>' (<a href="paper482#pet08">Peters and Weller 2008</a>).
Angeletou <em>et al.</em> (<a href="paper482#ang07">2007</a>) found that synonymy,
broader, narrower and related term relationships existed amongst tags.  It was
also indicated that these relationship types can be used for further refining
and expanding knowledge organization systems or ontologies. The aim of Veres's
study was to uncover the structural properties of tag sets as they relate to
Websites. The <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/" target="_blank"><em>Open Directory
Project</em></a> and the <em><a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/"
target="_blank">Yahoo Directory</a></em> were compared for the kinds of
classification within the user tags. <!-- The linguistic properties of
folksonomies both demonstrate similar categories in standard taxonomy while
containing additional tags to describe class properties. --> This has
implications for the connection between folksonomy and ontology. </p>

 <p> There have been studies comparing the Library of Congress Subject Headings
with the tags provided by users in various online tagging programmes and
communities.  Yi and Chan (<a href="paper482#yi09">2009</a>) reviewed over 4,000
articles that had been tagged using the <em>Delicious</em> bookmarking system.
The tags that had been assigned to these Websites were compared to the Library
of Congress Subject Headings to examine the term to term matches between the
words in the subject heading list and the tags.  It was found that of those tags
used twice or more, 61% matched the subject headings.  An additional 10% were
possible matches, such as the tag 'css' for the subject heading 'Cascading Style
Sheet' (<a href="paper482#yi09">Yi and Chan 2009</a>). In a later study, Yi examined the
tags on a sample of the most popular books on <em>LibraryThing</em> and their
relation to the assigned Library of Congress subject headings. Yi used the
similarity measures to predict the correct subject headings from user-assigned
tags. The most effective tags were the top five. This study demonstrated that
the similarity measures can predict the correct subject headings. </p>

 <p> Heymann and Garcia-Molina (<a href="paper482#hey09">2009</a>) conducted another
study in which they also compared term to term matches and semantic matches
between Library of Congress Subject Headings and tags assigned to books in

<em>LibraryThing</em>.  Similarly to the previously discussed studies, they also
found that there was a high number of matches between the tags and the subject
headings.  However, they also found that the tags, while there were
terminological matches, were often applied to various items that in actuality
had little in common.  <!-- '<em>Even though an LCSH keyword and a tag may be
syntactically the same, often the two keywords may annotate almost completely
different groups of books</em>'  (<a href="#hey09">Heymann and Garcia-Molina
2009</a>). --> This present study examines the tags and subject headings both at
semantic and terminological levels, with the primary focus on the semantic level
analysis. </p>

 <p> In this study, individual books form the base unit of analysis.  Subject
headings and tags of individual books were compared to one another on a
book-by-book basis rather than comparing all subject heading in the sample with
all tags in the sample aggregated.  Examining the subject headings and tags
assigned to a single book provides context to the analysis, rather than using an
aggregation of tags and subject headings assigned to a large, diverse sample of
items. </p>

 <h3>Complementary and  alternative medicine</h3>

 <p> Complementary and alternative medicine was the field chosen for this
examination, because of its increased importance, use and popularity among the
public at large.  The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine
(NCCAM) defines complementary medicine as '<em>a group of diverse medical and
health care systems, practices and products that are not presently considered to
be part of conventional medicine.  Complementary medicine is used with
conventional medicine and alternative medicine is used in place of conventional
medicine</em>' (<a href="paper482#nat10">NCCAM 2010</a>).  Complementary and alternative
medicine includes various therapies such as chiropractic, acupuncture and
massage, as well as preventive and self-help measures such as nutrition and
diet, herbal supplements, use of magnets and meditation.  Some specific examples
include:</p>

 <blockquote> <ul> <li>alternative whole medical systems (homeopathic and
naturopathic, Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine)</li> <li> mind–body interventions
(meditation, prayer, mental healing, art, music and dance therapy) </li>
<li>biologically based therapies (herbs, foods, vitamins and other dietary
supplements, including natural products such as shark cartilage) </li>
<li>manipulative and body-based methods (chiropractic and osteopathic
manipulation, massage) </li> <li>energy therapies (qi gong, Reiki, therapeutic
touch and electromagnetic field exposure) (<a href="paper482#nat10">NCCAM 2010</a>)
</li>  </ul> </blockquote>

 <p> There is an increasing use and awareness of these methods as shown by the
2007 National Health Interview Survey, which showed that roughly 38% of adult
Americans use complementary and alternative therapies (<a href="paper482#nat10">NCCAM
2010</a>).  One of the most often used types is dietary supplements.  In one
study, it was found that natural products (non-vitamin, non-mineral supplements)
were most commonly used for children and adults.  Many therapies such as
meditation, massage and yoga are also quite popular with the general public (<a
href="paper482#nah10">Nahin <em>et al.</em> 2010</a>).  These popular treatments have
brought attention to the field; conventional medicine is also slowly becoming
aware of the increased use of complementary and alternative therapies.  While
the public waits for conventional medicine to fully integrate with these
therapies in a comprehensive health care system, many are turning to popular
literature on the subject (<a href="paper482#ven10">Ventola 2010</a>).  Therefore,
librarians have a central role in providing access to this information and to
the increasing scholarly literature in the field.  '<em>A CAM librarian's role
is unique; many specialize in specific areas of CAM and opportunities exist for
librarians to partner with CAM groups. CAM information professionals' major
roles involve information access and retrieval and education</em>' (<a
href="paper482#cru06">Crumley 2006: 81</a>). </p>

 <p> One form of access that librarians provide is subject access and, for
book-type materials, they often use the Library of Congress Subject Headings.
With Web 2.0, user tags have also become very popular. While there is prolific
research output in the area of user tags and subject headings, there have been
no studies that examine the tags and the headings for popular book type
materials in complementary and alternative medicine.  Research and discussion on
this topic is significant because of the growing awareness and interest in this
field and because there are increasing numbers of users looking for such
information.  It is important to have an understanding of how social tagging
efforts and traditional subject access work together in this domain. </p>

 <h2>Methods</h2>

 <p> The purpose of this study is to understand patterns in the user tags and
examine how tags and tag categories relate to and supplement the subject
headings assigned by information professionals to popular materials within
complementary and alternative medicine.  This study will provide some
qualitative information of the issues and benefits of tags and subject headings,
so that a large-scale research study of the semantic relationships between
subject headings and social tags can be undertaken in the future. </p>

 <ul> <li>The research question addressed in this study is: What are the types
of semantic-based matches that exist between professionally-assigned subject
headings and user-assigned tags in popular materials on complementary and
alternative medicine?</li> </ul> 

 <p> Forty books on complementary and alternative medicine were analysed.
Books were selected by searching the <em>LibraryThing</em> database.  A search
was made for the tag 'alternative medicine'.  The top twenty books that listed
this term most frequently as a tag were chosen for the study.  The same was done
for books using the term 'complementary medicine'.  Again, the top twenty books
were chosen.  These books were of a popular, general nature and were intended
for the public at large.  To avoid repetition of books in the sample, a book
that had been previously listed in the alternative medicine group was not
repeated in the complementary medicine group.  The sample included a wide
variety of books on different treatments and different opinions of alternative
medicine, as well as case studies.  A limitation of this study is the sample
size of only forty books, but as this research is intended to be an exploratory
study, the sample was considered adequate.  The data ere collected during
January and February of 2010.    </p>

 <p> The MARC records for these books were obtained from the OCLC Connexion
database and the records were used to create a Microsoft Access database
containing the user tags, subject headings and subject heading subdivisions.
The database enabled the subject headings to be sorted by type of subdivisions
($x, y, z and v of MARC sub-field codes).  This was done to help understand the
type of subject headings and subdivisions assigned to these books. This database
could also present the tags and the corresponding subject headings of individual
books.  The total number of tags in the sample of forty books was 2,074.  Table
1 presents data on the mean number of subject headings and the mean number of
tags.  </p>

 <tr><th valign="middle">Partial</th><td valign="middle">(a) One or more of the
exact words within the subject heading were used.  May or may not include
additional words that are not part of the subject heading. Example: Holistic
health (SH) and 'health', 'holistic', or 'holistic medicine'.<br />

 (b) The tag was covered by more than one subject heading.  Example:
'complementary medicine' and Complementary therapies (SH) and Alternative
medicine (SH).<br />

 (c) Language and spelling variations, such as the exact term in another
language or a clear abbreviation of the exact terms.  Example: Alternative
medicine (SH) and 'alternativmedicin', 'medicin'  or 'altmedicine'.  </td></tr>

<tr><th valign="middle">None</th><td valign="middle">(a) Tags that included none
of the words in the subject heading.<br /> (b) Conceptual variations.  These are
related concepts that are two separate entities, but are closely related.
Examples: Vegetarian (SH) and 'vegetarianism' as well as Herbs (SH) and
'herbal'.  This was done because the true meanings of the tags and subject
headings differ.</td></tr> </table> 

 <p> Each subject heading was compared independently with the tags assigned to
that book.  If a book had three subject headings and thirty tags, then there was
a total of ninety subject heading to tag comparisons. Thus, the total number for
the complementary medicine counts is 2,963 and for alternative medicine 2,758.
These totals were used for determining the percentages of the matches.</p>

 <p>The tags were then examined for conceptual meaning.  To do this, tag
categories were created.  These categories were labelled and defined and the
definitions applied to a group of tags that had a form of commonality. For
example, the tags <em>bones</em>, <em>stomach</em> and <em>heart</em> were
grouped into a tag category called <em>Body parts</em>, with the added statement
that this group contained those tags that named specific areas or organs of the
human body.  This assisted the researchers in developing the tag categories
consistently and ensured that the conceptual meaning was retained for comparison
with subject headings. </p>

 <p> Tag categories were created because it is not effective to compare
individual tags semantically with subject headings.  Individual tags do not lend
themselves to semantic analysis because they vary so widely, they do not have
context when they stand alone and there are simply so many of them.  When
grouped by conceptual similarity, rather than alphabetically or by frequency as
in tag clouds, the context becomes richer and more meaningful.  Also, the tags
were categorized for each book and this provided an implicit context by keeping
all of the tags for each book separate from the tags of other books.  This
context and understanding of the tags and their meanings thus facilitated the
comparison of the subject headings with the tags and allowed the determination,
on a deeper level, of the types of semantic relationships represented. </p>

 <p> In the process of assigning the tags to the categories, they naturally
resulted in mutually exclusive categories for the individual books. However, a
tag that appeared for multiple books may have been assigned to different tag
categories for different books as each book exhibited its own contextual themes.
</p>

 <p> The process of sorting these tags into meaningful categories was done by
two individuals, both with non-medical backgrounds. The individuals reflect the
typical readership of these kinds of popular texts; medical practitioners are
not generally the intended audience. The two individuals sorted the tags into
categories, which were then compared. Where there were differences, these were
discussed and a consensus reached.  In cases where a consensus could not be
reached and there were different points of view, an information professional was
consulted and the three together reached a decision. This to some extent allowed
for some degree of inter-reliability of any subjective decisions made by the
individuals. </p>

 <p> This resulted in a total of 375 tag categories.  The next step was to map
the tag categories on to the subject headings for each  book.  The same two
individuals mapped the tags and the results were reviewed by the information
professional.  To guide this process, the Current Relations in the Semantic
Network of the Unified Medical Language System was used (<a
href="paper482#nat10.2">National Institutes of Health 2010</a>).  <a
href="paper482#appa">Appendix A</a> shows the full list of these relationships.  This
provided a framework for identifying the types of relationships that existed
between the subject headings and the tag categories and was selected because it
is relevant to the biomedical field and is a higher level overview of possible
relationships. </p>

 <h2>Analysis and results</h2>

 <p> The MARC records for the forty sample books were examined for their
subject headings.  These subject headings fell into the 6xx fields and most were
drawn from the Library of Congress Subject Headings.  </p>

 <p> The Library of Congress Subject Headings allows for personal names,
topical headings, geographic headings, etc.  In addition, to increase
specificity, a subject heading can have subdivisions, such as topical ($x),
geographic ($z), chronological ($y) and form ($v).  The nature of the subject
headings and subdivisions was examined to determine the nature of the subject
headings and subdivisions used in this domain. </p>

 <p> In the total sample of books in complementary and alternative medicine,
the subject headings primarily belonged to the MARC field 650, Topical Subject
Headings.  These headings covered a wide range of topics such as

<em>Complementary therapies</em>, <em>Evidence-based medicine</em>, <em>Massage
therapy</em>, <em>Self-help groups</em>, <em>Diet</em>, <em>Spiritual
healing</em> and <em>Medicine, ayurvedic</em>.  The headings did not contain any
Corporate Name (MARC field 610) or Geographic Name headings (MARC field 611).
Personal Name headings (MARC field 600) were included only twice.   </p>

 <p> With regard to subdivisions, approximately one third of the headings had
subdivisions.  Fifty-five percent of the subdivisions were Form subdivisions
($v);  74% of the Form subdivisions used the term 'Popular works'.  Other form
subdivisions included 'Encyclopedia' and 'Handbooks, manuals, etc.', 'Biography'
and 'Formulae, receipts and prescriptions'.  The Topical subdivision ($x) also
occurred quite frequently, 39% of the time.  Within this subdivision,
'Prevention' and 'Prevention and control' were used often.  The general
subdivisions covered a wide range of topics and included terms such as 'Cancer',
'Diet therapy', 'Evaluation', 'Methods', and 'Therapeutic Use', etc.  The
Geographical subdivision ($z) occurred rarely and there was no occurrence of the
Chronological subdivision ($y). </p>

 <p> The results of the individual tag and subject heading comparison are
presented in Table 3.   </p>

 <p>The full matches were only 0.74% and 1.7% of the total number of matches,
for complementary and alternative medicines respectively.  The partial matches
were 3.51% and 7.7% for complementary and alternative medicine respectively and
the tags that did not match were 95.75% and 90.6%, also respectively.  This
showed that the conceptual analysis was needed; there were so few exact
terminological matches and partial matches in this domain that further
investigation was needed to determine, at the conceptual level, whether or not
there were similarities between tags and the subject headings.</p>

 <p> The sorting of the tags into tag categories resulted in 375 categories,
where the tags contained within each category were related in different ways. A
statement describing the meaning of each category was developed and this aided
the process of semantically mapping each tag category with the subject headings.
 Some examples include the tag categories <em>Total care</em> and <em>Item
description</em>.  The <em>Total care</em>category was described by the
statement '<em>terms that address both mainstream and alternative medicine to
treat the whole person, not just the illnesses</em>'.  This tag category
included the tags <em>holistic, holistic health, holistic medicine</em> and

<em>wellbeing</em>.  In the tag category <strong>Item Description</strong>, the
statement 'descriptions of the physical item itself' was used and this tag
category included the tags of <em>hardcover</em> and <em>paperback</em>. For
Case 1 later in this section, the tag cloud for the item, along with the tag
categories and their assigned tags, are presented in full.  These tag categories
were then mapped on to the subject headings through a set of semantic
relationships assisted by the <em>Current Relations in the Semantic Network</em>
chart.  The <em>Current Relations</em> framework identifies several types of
relationships and associations under the general rubric of 'associated _with'.
Within this rubric, it lists the relationships  <em>physically_related_to</em>,

<em>functionally_related_to</em>, <em>spatially_related_to</em>,
<em>temporally_related_to</em> and <em>conceptually_related_to</em>. Within each
of these categories there are further breakdowns that can be viewed in <a
href="paper482#appa">Appendix A</a> and the exact descriptions of these relationships as
adapted for this study are provided in <a href="paper482#appb">Appendix B</a>. </p>

 <p>The conceptual comparison of the tag categories and subject headings
revealed that almost half of the tag categories could be mapped, in terms of
semantic meaning, to the subject headings.  Slightly more than half of the tag
categories could not be mapped to the assigned subject headings.  Those that
could be mapped are described as related and those that could not be mapped are
described as unrelated.  Table 4 presents the overall results of the semantic
relationship analysis between the tag categories and the subject headings. </p>

 <p> The most frequently occurring semantic relationship types were
<em>functionally_related_to</em>, <em>physically_related_to</em> and

<em>conceptually_related_to</em>.</p>

 <p> In both complementary medicine and alternative medicine 29.2% of tag
categories fell into the <em>physically_related_to</em> relationship.  Within
this, the sub-relationships of (<em>part_of</em>), (<em>branch_of</em>) and
(<em>ingredient_of</em>) occurred.  (<em>Part_of</em>) occurred most often, both
within this relationship type and in all the different relationship types as a
whole.</p>

 <p> The <em>functionally_related_to</em> relationship in both complementary
medicine and alternative medicine included the subsets (<em>treats</em>),
(<em>interacts_with</em>), (<em>produces</em>), (<em>causes</em>),
(<em>carries_out</em>), (<em>practices</em>), (<em>occurs_in</em>

(<em>process_of</em>)) and (<em>users</em>).  Much of the data was evenly
distributed among these subsets.  However, the subsets of (<em>result_of</em>)
and (<em>manifestion_of</em>) had a much higher representation, which led to the
idea that cause-effect connection strongly exists, as well as the expressions
and examples of concepts. </p>

 <p><em>Conceptually_related_to</em> had many subsets and also had a high
number of occurrences.  It included the subsets (<em>evaluation_of</em>),
(<em>analyses</em> (<em>assesses_effect_of</em>)), (<em>property_of</em>),
(<em>method_of</em>), (<em>conceptual_part_of</em>) and (<em>issue_in</em>).
The most frequent sub-relationships were (<em>property_of</em>) and
(<em>issue_in</em>) and these appeared with high frequency in both.  The
(<em>conceptual_part_of</em>) also occurred frequently, but only in alternative
medicine. </p>

 <p> The occurrence of (<em>spatially_related_to</em>) was very minimal and
primarily occurred in the context of (<em>location_of</em>), which often
referred to the country of origin or practice.  (<em>Temporally_related_to</em>)
was not present in alternative medicine and in complementary medicine it
occurred only three times. </p>

 <h3>Subject headings and tag categorizations: unrelated</h3>

 <p> There were 121 unrelated tag categories in alternative medicine and 109 in
complementary medicine.  54.1% of all tag categories were unrelated to the
subject headings.  Further analysis of these unrelated tag categories was
undertaken to identify patterns and to understand what value they could add. The
following outlines the process of determining these patterns using an example.
The unrelated tag categories were aggregated into one group and were examined
for similarities between them.  For instance, several books had tags that
appeared to be call numbers or shelf labels.  During the initial analysis, these
tags were grouped into the tag categories of <em>place</em> or <em>item
location</em>.  It was determined that these tag categories had nothing to do
with the subject headings assigned to the book.  Secondary analysis of all of
the unrelated tag categories as a whole yielded the identification that several
books had tag categories such as <em>place</em> or <em>item location</em>; the
phenomenon, labelled a pattern, was designated  as the <em>location</em>

pattern.  Table 6 shows all of the patterns within the unrelated tag categories
and gives a description of each pattern. </p>

 <p>The most frequently occurring patterns were <em>personal</em>, <em>genre or
form</em> and <em>location</em>.  <em>Time period</em> and <em>belief
systems</em> were also very high.  The unrelated tag categories demonstrate the
added value of using tags: they supplement the existing subject headings.  For
instance, the tag categories in the <em>assessment</em> pattern can assist
readers in evaluating the relevance of an item to their purposes.</p>

 <p> Another example is <em>content terms</em>.  One book, about aromatherapy
and energy therapy, has only the subject heading '<em>Flowers</em>'.  Medical
tags and tag categories do not relate to this subject heading, but do provide
additional information.  These tags included '<em>energy therapy</em>' and
'<em>spiritual healing</em>' and tag categories include '<em>complementary and
alternative medicine</em>', '<em>mental health</em>' and '<em>medicine</em>'.
They could have been used as subject headings to represent the book but were
not, thus the tags fill the gap by providing additional information about the
content of the book.  This information is very valuable in assisting the user to
find the information that they are seeking; had the user searched a traditional
catalogue  for '<em>energy therapy</em>' or '<em>complementary medicine</em>'
the user would not have found this item, but if the user instead searched the
tags for this item it would have been returned. </p>

 <p> The next section provides three detailed examples, drawn from specific
books, of the subject heading and tag category connections.</p>

 <h4>Case 1</h4>

 <p> The book in question is actually a collection of stories from people
suffering from critical illnesses and the author, a Crohn's disease sufferer.
It can be found at <a
href="http://www.librarything.com/work/42829">http://www.li
rarything.com/work/42829</a>.  This book concerns how these individuals dealt
with spiritual and medical crises.  The subject headings assigned to this book
are 'Meditations' and 'Physicians&ndash;United States&mdash;Biography'.
Additional name subject headings in the 600 field include 'Remen, Rachel Naomi'
and 'Remen, Rachel Naomi – Philosophy'.  The scope note for the heading
'Meditations' in the 32nd edition of the Subject Headings states: '<em>Here are
entered collections of thoughts on spiritual truths for use in meditation.
Works on mental prayer as a method of promoting the spiritual life are entered
under Meditation</em>' (<a href="paper482#lib32">Library of Congress 2010</a>). </p>

 <p> The subject headings, while they indicate the broad theme, do not indicate
the specific concepts of the book.  Tags in the category
<strong>Uplifting</strong> get to a closer degree of describing what the book is
about.  The book is not a collection of prayers or meditations, but of personal
experiences.  While intended to help others facing difficulties, it is not
intended to promote a spiritual life.  It is meant to be uplifting and
inspirational, but the subject headings 'Meditation' and
'Physicians&ndash;United States&mdash;Biography', although relevant, do not
address all the details. The tags that are associated with this book do reflect
this difference.  The tags reflect peoples' reactions. The tag category
<strong>Uplifting</strong> include tags that lift the spirit or mind to a level
of happiness. The subject headings have tried to describe the book objectively,
but the tags show how people feel about the book.  The impact of the book is
also important as is the subject of the book. </p>

 <p> Information about the genre helps readers know what to expect in terms of
content style. Hence the tags biography, essays, memoir, non-fiction and
self-help were sorted into the tag category <strong>Genre</strong>.  The subject
heading could include the genre of the book but it is often limited to one
description. For this book the heading 'Biography' is included as a subheading
of 'Physicians', while the users gave many descriptions: biography, essays,
memoir, non-fiction and stories.  This is also helpful when books cross multiple
lines into different genres.  </p>

 <p> The category of <strong>Demographics</strong> also helps readers to
determine who and what the book is about, in a more specific way than the
subject headings. Adult, Jewish and women were sorted into this category. Jewish
was placed in this category and not the <strong>Religion</strong> category as
this describes a person and is not referring to the religion. The tags describe
the people who have contributed their stories to the work. </p>

 <p> <strong>Communication</strong>, or tags that are concerned with how people
pass on information, included both tags of a personal nature (read and unread)
and the tags stories and storytelling. Tags of a personal nature help individual
users but not the general public.   </p>

 <p> The tag category <strong>Understanding</strong> alludes to personal
understanding and people search and acquire it. Tags of meditation, philosophy
and wisdom were sorted into this category.  </p>

 <p> Judaism, religion, spirit, spiritual and spirituality were included in the
<strong>Religion</strong> tag category, which was defined as the belief in a
higher power or other methods of mental transcendence.  </p>

 <p> The category <strong>Medicine</strong> included tags which had to do with
the field of medicine and its effect, including complementary medicine, medical,
medicine and psychology.  </p>

 <p> Tags concerned with <strong>Disease</strong> and its eradication include
cancer, health, life and healing. This sorting is the result of comprehensive
discussion and consensus between the two researchers and the information
professional. </p>

 <p> The tag cloud for this work is presented below: </p>

 <div align="center"><img src="http://www.informationr.net/ir/16-3/p482fig1.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Tag cloud representing the book from Case 1"  /></div> 
<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 1: Tag cloud representing the book from Case 1</strong></div>

 <h4>Case 2</h4>

 <p> This book is a critique of the self-help movement in America today. It can
be found at <a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/560631">
http://www.librarything.com/work/560631.</a>  The subject headings are
'Self-help groups', 'Self-actualization (Psychology)', and 'Recovery movement'.
These subject headings could go into more detail by adding the subheading
'Criticism' or 'Evaluation' to any of the main headings.  However, the
professional cataloguers did not choose to do so.  The tags have an important
place in showing the critical viewpoint of the author.  This is crucial, because
anyone researching the self-help movement for critical evaluation would not be
able to assess this from the subject headings and anyone looking for methods of
self-help to follow may not find this item useful when it is returned in a list
of search results.  This is a case where the evaluative aspects are covered by
the tags in category <strong>Scepticism</strong> and not by the subject
headings. </p>

 <p>Politics and culture are also reflected in the tags and these affect how a
user may evaluate an item.  These sorts of belief systems can influence how the
information is perceived.  This book has both supporters and detractors; some
tags indicate the author's altruism and some indicate the opposite.  The tags
reflect these reactions and judgments in a way that objective subject headings
do not express. </p>

 <p> Time period is also reflected.  One of the aspects of physical books is
that they often are less ephemeral than other information types such as
Websites.  In physical form, they are more permanent.   For physical books, not
everyone is going to read the book at the same time and the book is likely to
trade hands.  Some tags, despite their personal nature, indicate when the book
was read, bought, sold, or stored and show that the book is still conveying its
information to users.  Even though these tags may not be useful for access
purposes, they still in some way convey useful information.  It shows that the
book is still relevant and useful to many readers. </p>

 <h4>Case 3</h4>

 <p> This example can be located at <a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/30181">http://www.librarything.com/work/306181</a>.  The author presents techniques for using one's <em>positive energy</em> to overcome fatigue.
The subject headings are 'Energy medicine' and 'Mental healing'.  The book
offers different strategies to boost energy, improve relationships and combat
the things that drain energy.  Part of this is keeping fit and the book
describes how to do it by oneself.  This is change performed by the individual;
working on all of the things in the <strong>Fitness</strong> tag category (such
as <em>bodywork, strength,</em> and <em>fitness</em>) leads to the

<em>achievement, courage, healing,</em> and <em>growth,</em> that are found in
the <strong>Personal growth</strong> category. </p>

 <p> And since this is done on one's own, <em>self-development, self-help,</em>
and <em>self-improvement</em> are also included.  These tags, when taken
together, provide a more detailed summary of what the book is about.  It is a
self-help book intended to help readers learn to deal with the stress and trials
of everyday life through the application of positive thoughts and actions;
'Energy medicine' and 'Mental healing' are appropriate headings, but the
unrelated tag categories provide a different level of specificity that readers
can use for their own purposes. </p>

 <h2>Discussion</h2>

 <p> In particular, social tagging seems to be especially important in popular
literature pertaining to complementary and alternative medicine, where it
appears that a large portion of the readership comes from the general public,
who are likely to be unfamiliar with the controlled vocabulary phrases and
medical terminology.  From the tag analysis, it is clear that there is a variety
of ways that the public describes complementary and alternative medicine.  It is
also clear from the literature that many people are interested in and are
actively pursuing information on the subject.  In general, they are searching
for information on these methods to treat medical issues and prevent other
issues from arising.  They also appear to be looking for pain management
techniques and natural methods of medical treatment.  As such, it is critical to
develop improved access to popular materials in this area. </p>

 <p> Looking at the catalogue records, the access is provided mainly by topical
subject headings (650 field of the MARC record).  The subject headings tend to
be very broad, general and repetitive across the collection.  Examples include
headings such as, 'Complementary therapies', 'Alternative medicine', and 'Mental
healing'.  Subject headings, although they provide appropriate access, may not
serve the purpose of effectively organizing, filtering and retrieving books of
such a nature.  They may not adequately create distinct groups or discriminate
between specific topics.  They also lack subdivisions represented by genre and
target audience, which can be represented by subject headings, but these
subdivisions were rarely applied to any of the books in the sample. </p>

 <p> The overwhelming percentage of tags that did not match the subject
headings shows that the tags contribute a plethora of unique terms for the user
search and retrieval.  This terminological analysis shows that tags enhance
access to the material in ways that assigned subject headings may not.  Tags
complement and augment the subject headings in providing improved access to
collections.   </p> <p> Since the subject headings were very broad, the
terminological matches between subject headings and tags were very minimal.
Many of the tags that matched with the subject headings were general tags like
'alternative' or 'health'.   Full matches were much rarer than partial matches,
because a tag phrase including all of the words as the subject heading is much
less likely than a partial match.  Partial matches are much more likely to occur
given that a term can be repeated and combined infinitely with any and all words
in the vast and varied English vocabulary. </p>

 <p> Although the tag and subject heading terminological matches were minimal,
it is clear that there were semantic similarities between tags and the subject
headings and that these tags helped expand the central idea represented by the
subject heading.  For example, the tag <em>Herbs</em> matched the subject
heading of 'Herbs – Therapeutic use' assigned to a particular book.  While the
subject heading was very broad, the tags represented multiple concepts and
provided additional detail and more avenues for exploration than just this
single heading.  Tags that provided said detail and avenues were <em>economic
botany and herbalism, herbal medicine, herbs, medicinal herbs,</em> and
<em>medicinal plants</em>.  Each of these is a similar concept representing a
different aspect of <em>Herbs.  Economic botany and herbalism</em> can refer to
the farming and sale of herbs.  <em>Herbal medicine</em> is using these herbs to
treat medical problems.  <em>Herbs</em> as a tag describes the physical material
used and medicinal herbs is a subset.  <em>Medicinal plants</em> relate to
herbal medicine by treating medical issues, but may in fact not actually be
classified as herbs. <em>Medicinal plants</em> and <em>herbs</em> can be seen as
having a quasi-generic relationship, since some medicinal plants can be herbs
(medicinal herbs) and some herbs can be medicinal plants.  As regards the
Library of Congress Subject Headings record for the subject heading
'Herbs&mdash;Therapeutic use' it contains only narrower terms (NT) and  these
are 'Herbal abortifacients' and 'Herbal contraceptives',  and the used for (UF)
terms include 'Herb remedies', Herbal medicine', and 'Medicinal herbs'. (Library
of Congress 2010).  Although the term Herbs appears in both the tags and the
Subject Headings, the tags distinctly encompass a broader range of topics than
solely the therapeutic use of herbs.  Although the terminological matches were
few, the tags provided a rich source of information.  Creating tag categories
and semantically matching them with the subject headings as previously detailed
allowed for this information to be further explored.</p>

 <p> Forty-six percent of the subject headings semantically matched with tag
categories.  This is a high proportion of matches, which indicates that many of
the concepts and meanings represented in the tags in some way matched the
thematic content of the book.  The subject headings focus on the main subject of
the document, but tags provide a more detailed and deeper representation of the
content.  In addition, some of the unrelated tag categories (such as
<strong>Content</strong> or <strong>Evaluative terms</strong>) also contain
useful information that is not reflected in the subject headings.  It appears to
be a tendency for users of popular works in complementary and alternative
medicine to contrast complementary and alternative medicine with mainstream
medicine and view the two forms as opposites.  As such, the users tag materials
with terms that evaluate the content of the books in terms of positive and
negative.  <em>Scepticism</em> and <em>quackery</em> are two examples and often
these terms result from contrasting the complementary and alternative medical
material with that of mainstream conventional medicine. </p>

 <p> Other results of this study indicated that a few patterns that emerged out
of the unrelated tag categories could be focused on because they bring added
value to search and access. The most frequently used patterns were
<em>Demographics and age</em>, <em>Genre or type</em> and <em>Location</em>.
This could be because tags are often used as a method of recommending books to
others; as a general rule, people who enjoy one kind of book may enjoy a book
that belongs to the same demographic description or genre.  For example, in the
book used in the Case 1, the tags included terms such as <em>adult, Jewish,</em>
and <em>women</em> and these tags alluded to the ethnic and religious background
of the author.  This type of unrelated pattern, called 'demographics and age',
was found to add value by providing context information.  This information may
be meaningful to users who are searching for materials that pertain to their own
demographics and backgrounds.  The tags that describe these things may help
readers be able to choose which books they will read next and the location tags,
such as classification numbers, help them to find the book in order to read it.
Also, subject headings are intended to be an objective assessment of the content
of the book, while the user generated tags can be subjective and the opinions
that they can offer may help guide other users in a different and necessary
fashion.</p>

 <p> The pattern <em>Genre or form</em> is often used.  For the book
<em>Kitchen table wisdom</em> by Rachel Naomi Remen, the users provided a
variety of tags that were different expressions of genre.  The work was tagged
as a <em>biography, a memoir, a story,</em> and as <em>essays</em>. Essentially,
it could be all four in the minds of the readers.  However, the assigned subject
headings provided only one subdivision: '<em>Biography</em>'.  This also
indicates that users' tags contribute to a prolific number of newer and unique
terms and concepts not represented in the assigned subject headings.  While
recognizing the importance for subject headings assigned by professionals as
essential, it is important to also recognize the value of the rich set of terms
contributed by the users and leverage these for better access to complementary
and alternative medicine materials. </p>

 <p> The approach of examining the user tags and the subject headings through
the set of semantic categories assisted by the Unified Medical Language System,
Current Relations allowed the identification of semantic categories embedded in
the user tags and not represented by the subject headings.  This approach could
be explored further, in examining and validating the semantic richness of the
tags.  Additionally, the results generated by such studies have some potential
for use in the construction of ontologies, knowledge organization systems and
query expansions. </p>

 <h2> Conclusions </h2>

 <p> The emphasis of complementary and alternative medicine, being holistic in
nature, seems to be on prevention and overall wellbeing.  This is important for
the health of the general public and gives them knowledge of the options they
can explore.  This focus and increasing awareness of personal health makes
access to health literature important and better methods of access are crucial.
</p>

 <p> In looking at the tag categories created from the user tags assigned to
books, there are very few on specific diseases like cancer or of individual
treatments.  It covers categories that suggest spiritual or metaphysical aspects
that are part of holistic health.  The unrelated tags are not necessarily
content terms but represent viewpoints and opinions and locations, genres and
demographics etc, also abound.  They provide information beyond what the
assigned subject headings currently address.  Thus, the tags contribute valuable
additional information for the book type material in complementary and
alternative medicine. </p>

 <p> The fact that 46% of tag categories are conceptually matched with the
subject headings and 54% are non-matches indicates that both the subject
headings assigned by professionals and the user generated tags are essential to
provide effective access to the resources in complementary and alternative
medicine.  An organization of user tags is necessary for presenting the tags to
the user for browsing, search and navigation.  Many ways of organization,
including that of facets, have been suggested in the literature (<a
href="paper482#ram10">Ram and Wei 2010</a>; <a href="paper482#spi10">Spiteri 2010</a>).
Presentation and organization in the user interface design are outside the scope
of this study.  </p>

 <p> The Unified Medical Language System, Current Relations in Semantic Network
Schema was found very useful and appropriate as a framework for analysis and
future use of such schemas for semantic relationships analysis is suggested.
This study also contributes toward this methodology for analysing the semantic
relationships in this domain. </p>

 <p> Social tags and assigned subject headings are complementary and both
approaches are important to provide improved access to users.  This study
suggests that there are important types of semantic relationships that are
relevant in the organization and retrieval of popular, general materials in the
field of complementary and alternative medicine and also suggests the ways that
they can add value to and complement the subject headings.</p>

 <p> Health information technicians, Web search engine professionals and health
care professionals are some of the groups who could ultimately benefit from this
type of analysis. Especially with the growing interest in complementary and
alternative medicine, newer methods for improved access are valuable and needed.
 The knowledge gained from such studies can contribute towards an understanding
of the relationship types that are important in developing ontologies and
knowledge structures for Web-based applications. </p>
