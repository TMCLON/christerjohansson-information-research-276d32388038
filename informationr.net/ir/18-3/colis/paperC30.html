<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In 1992, Frohman showed information science’s literature to be 
dominated by the cognitive viewpoint, wherein humans are conceived of as
 market entities and consumers of information systems. Little over two 
decades later, Buckland (<a href="paperC30.html#Buckland12">2012</a>) noted, "the 
current dominant paradigm is heavily influenced by cognitive science 
which is a logical and algorithmic research programme that investigates 
information processing in humans, animals, and machines" (p.4). A 
market-oriented and technology-restricted view of progress continues to 
dominate a large portion of information science’s literature and 
research. This view constituted the cornerstone of Marcuse’s criticism. 
Whether priority is accorded to the human or technical aspect of 
research, as information science often vacillates between the two (<a href="paperC30.html#Saracevic10">Saracevic, 2010</a>),
 depending on the researcher, Marcuse offered an invaluable groundwork 
with his idea of the individual’s fulfillment. With its fast and ever 
changing devices seen the last decades, the information age has brought 
Marcuse’s criticism into greater focus. Since the field of information 
science has a technical dimension, it can be argued that the usability 
and accessibility of information technologies and related methods must 
receive precedence in order to ensure greater social progress. 
Nevertheless, as Buckland (<a href="paperC30.html#Buckland12">2012</a>) clarified, 
"formal and quantitative, however useful, can never be more than in 
highly valued <em>auxiliary roles</em> [emphasis added]" (p. 6). Any progress or 
improved technology, albeit accessible and usable, should aim for the 
quality of humans lives, and not the quantity nor quality of human 
tools. In other words, technology, regardless of its form (i.e., 
digital, online, material, etc.), can and should remain an auxiliary 
tool of humans. For the information age and its overwhelmingly touted 
progress, Marcuse’s reflections serve as an important resource for 
supporting human actualization.</p>       

<p>Arguments can be made that every epoch has been an information age. 
Humans had searched and lived with information under different 
circumstances for different reasons and at different times. In this 
paper, however, the concept information age indicates the societies 
that, in the aftermath of World War II, have taken on infinitesimal 
capacities of information storage and digital dimensions of human 
interactions and transactions. These newly adopted forms of societies 
and information processes have shaped our notion of technological 
progress, and have even become, some would argue, who we, humans, are. 
Marcuse devoted extensive attention to the topic of technology and the 
progress it entails. More particularly, his writings represent some of 
the most incisive sources with which to confront the information age. 
Meanwhile, Marcuse’s works are little known in the social sciences, 
including information science. The main reason is that his oeuvre has 
been buried in philosophical circles and controversies. The second 
reason lies in the limitation of Marcuse to Marxism. The third and last 
reason is that Marcuse has been reduced to the 1960s socialistic and 
leftist movements of Europe and their allies. However, although not 
always acknowledged in the literature, Marcuse was one of the stiffest 
critics of both Marxism and socialism. Marcuse (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse64">1964</a>) argued, </p>

<blockquote>"Socialistic" are all encroachments on private enterprises 
not undertaken by private enterprise itself (or by government 
contracts), such as universal and comprehensive health insurance, or the
 protection of nature from all too sweeping commercialization… In both 
camps [capitalist and communist], non-operational ideas are 
non-behavioural and subversive. The movement of thought is stopped at 
barriers which appear as the limits of Reason itself. (p. 14)</blockquote> 

<p>We will talk about operational behaviour later, for now bear in mind 
that operational (aka one-dimensional) behaviour is a machine-imposed 
behaviour that humans are required to adopt for the machine’s efficiency 
and society’s progress. Notice in passing the idea of <em>universal</em> and <em>comprehensive</em>
 health insurance that Marcuse defended teeth and nails in the 1960s, 
which was, and still is, largely ignored in academia in general and the 
literature concerned with Marcuse in particular, and now all the more 
urgent in our healthcare-crippled societies. As apparent below, fuller 
freedom of individuals cannot be achieved when some areas of social life
 such as that of health are thought to be unimportant/tangential or 
require explanation in our field’s research.   </p>

<p>This paper, however, looks at Marcuse from the perspective of the 
information age. While the information, more precisely digital, age was 
not entirely afoot in Marcuse’s times, its society carries more than one 
aspect that Marcuse reflected on, making his writings one of the most 
relevant sources for generative thought about the problems and prospects
 facing information-driven social process. In this paper, five points of
 his thought, in particular, will guide our reflections: (1) background,
 (2) relevance, (3) negative thinking, (4) privacy, and (5) 
operationalism and case illustration. </p>
	
<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Herbert Marcuse was born in a middle-class Jewish family on July 19, 1898 in Berlin (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse04">Marcuse, 2004</a>; <a href="paperC30.html#Wiggershaus98">Wiggershaus, 1998</a>).
 His father moved from Pomerania (Northeast Germany) to Berlin, and, 
after years of hard work, was able to provide upper-class conditions to 
his wife and three children. Marcuse attended the universities of Berlin
 and Freiburg. In 1922, at the University of Freiburg, he received his 
PhD in German history, with a minor in philosophy and economics. In 
1928, after working a few years in Berlin, he took a job, at the 
University of Freiburg, as assistant to Heidegger, who just succeeded to
 Husserl as chair of philosophy. In 1932, Marcuse was recruited by Max 
Horkheimer as a member of the Frankfurt Institut für Sozialforschung 
[Frankfurt Institute of Social research] aka the Frankfurt School. The 
line of thought of the Frankfurt School is commonly called Critical 
Theory. Since its creation in 1922, the school was the rallying point of
 critical analysis of society. When Hitler rose to power in 1933, 
Marcuse fled to Geneva, Switzerland. In 1934, with Hitler’s expanding 
ambitions in Germany neighboring countries and Europe, Marcuse migrated 
to the US. In 1940, he became a US citizen. During the war, he worked as
 a war analyst for the US government. Thereafter, he held teaching 
posts, from 1951 to 1954 at Columbia University (New York) and Harvard 
University (Boston, MA), from 1954 to 1965 at Brandeis University 
(Waltham, MA), and from 1965 to 1976 at the University of California at 
San Diego. On July 29, 1979, on a visit to Germany, critical theorist 
Marcuse died of a stroke in Starnberg.  While most commentators focus on
 his brilliant scholarly works, Marcuse encountered various difficulties
 in his personal and professional life, for example, forced migration to
 Switzerland and US, the loss of his wife Sophie Wertheim, lack of job, 
tenures non-renewal, funding needs, etc. These adverse experiences 
caused Marcuse to devote extensive attention to the topic of technology 
and the progress it promises, which serves as the bedrock of Marcuse’s 
thoughts. The topic of technological progress preoccupied Marcuse all 
his life.</p> 

<p>The effects of technologies on the lives of humans have been a 
daunting concern of various authors across history, one of the earliest 
recorded materials of which goes as far back as Ancient Egypt, with the 
official Nefer-seshem-re (23th c. BC, <a href="paperC30.html#Lichtheim73">Lichtheim, 1973</a>).
 In ancient Egypt, a super-power for two millennia, technologies did not
 override/supplant humans, but were instead infused and adorned with 
human values, ideals, and beliefs. When it comes to Marcuse’s writings, 
some of the most cited reflections addressing the effects of 
technologies on humans are those made by Heidegger and Husserl since 
these authors reflections are believed to have decisively influenced 
Marcuse’s thinking.</p> 

<blockquote>One recognizes Husserlian and Heideggerian motifs in 
Marcuse’s critiques of scientific civilization and modes of thought. In 
particular, Marcuse develops a conception of a technological world, 
similar in some respects to that developed by Heidegger, and like 
Husserl and Heidegger, sees technological rationality colonizing 
everyday life, robbing individuals of freedom and individuality by 
imposing technological imperatives, rules, and structures upon their 
thought and behaviour. (<a href="paperC30.html#Kellner64">Kellner, 1964: xiii-xiv</a>) </blockquote>

<p>The imperatives imposed on humans and their behaviour and thought are
 the underlying theme of <em>One-dimensional Man</em> since these imperatives 
dictate one way or dimension of thinking and behaving. Although not the 
focus of this paper, Marcuse (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse72">1972</a>, <a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse41a">1941a</a>, <a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse41b">1941b</a>, <a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse60">1960</a>, <a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse64">1964</a>, <a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse66">1966</a>, <a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse69">1969</a>, <a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse74">1974</a>)
 departed from these and similar reflections on a number of fronts, 
namely, with his relentless criticism of themes such as social 
domination and its subtle ideologies, human behaviour and impulses, and 
communication and information means. Most relevant to our discussion, 
Marcuse took a highly critical approach toward communication and 
information means, and the mass and uncritical connection these 
technologies instill among people. Marcuse (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse64">1964</a>) wrote, </p>

<blockquote>The means of mass transportation and <em>communication</em>, the 
commodities of lodging, food, and clothing, the irresistible output of 
the entertainment and <em>information</em> [emphasis added] industry carry with 
them prescribed attitudes [uses] and habits [behaviours], certain 
intellectual and emotional reactions which bind the consumers more or 
less pleasantly to the producers and, through the latter, to the whole. 
(p. 12). </blockquote>

<p>Emotional and popular adoption, if not imposition, of commodities 
still govern the spread of technological tools for communication and 
information. When already in place, as has often been the case over the 
last few decades, new technological means for communication and 
information have become part of the naturalized infrastructure to human 
life that people have come to take for granted.  In contrast to other 
figures of the Frankfurt School, Marcuse insisted on the means of 
communication and information. Marcuse saw the new communication and 
information means as mere elements of functionality.</p> 

<blockquote>The instrumentalistic conception of technological 
rationality is spreading over almost the whole realm of thought… The 
improved facilities of transportation and communication, the extension 
of training, the general dissemination of knowledge – all these factors 
seem to facilitate the exchangeability of [rational] functions. (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse41a">Marcuse, 1941a: 430</a>)</blockquote> 

<p>This unnamed disuse and loss of reason that come under the banner of 
technological progress, are the beast that Marcuse fought teeth and 
nails against. Marcuse’s emphasis on the dehumanizing effects of new 
information technologies and their societies was relentless. Therefore, 
Marcuse strongly believed in the power of negative thinking. </p>
	
<h2>Relevance </h2>

<p>Clarification needs to be made in order to best picture the relevance
 of the Marcusian legacy. It is important to put down the lenses that 
color every critical position of society as Marxism and/or critical 
theory. Also, to be clear, this paper takes critical theory in the 
strict sense of the Frankfurt School. Although super-critical of 
society, one would argue, a number of figures of our times -- not to 
mention figures of other times of recorded history -- are neither 
Marxist nor critical theorists, such as Chomsky (<a href="paperC30.html#Chomsky87">1987</a>), Easterly (<a href="paperC30.html#Easterly06">2006</a>), Sen (<a href="paperC30.html#Sen09">2009</a>),
 etc. This does not mean that there cannot be some overlaps between 
these and many figures and Marxism and critical theory. It follows that 
one needs to avoid lumping together every work of Marcuse with critical 
theory and Marxism.</p> 

<blockquote>We see Marcuse as moving beyond traditional approaches to 
philosophical and social problems in a highly productive and relevant 
manner … confronting the multifaceted problems facing contemporary 
civilization as it continued to produce damaged conditions for human and
 non-human life… The effects of science and technological rationality on
 human life are just some of the examples of philosophical and social 
problems that Marcuse reinvented in novel ways. (<a href="paperC30.html#Kellner11">Kellner, Pierce, and Lewis, 2011</a>: 2, see also pp. 39-40 for advanced research on differences of Marcuse with the Frankfurt School) </blockquote>

<p>As is now clear, this paper is not claiming that information science has not witnessed critical theory work (see <a href="paperC30.html#Day01">Day, 2001</a>, <a href="paperC30.html#Day10">2010</a>, <a href="paperC30.html#Day11">2011</a>; <a href="paperC30.html#Leckie10">Leckie <em>et al.</em>, 2010</a>). More particularly, works of Marcuse have been presented in information science (<a href="paperC30.html#Pyati09">Pyati, 2009</a>, <a href="paperC30.html#Pyati10">2010</a>). However, this paper has captured some of the least researched central themes of Marcuse.</p>

<p>The relevance of Marcuse’s conceptions for information science can be 
found at several levels. As shown in the case illustration, our field’s 
insistence on and complacency with information technologies and their 
ever attractive applications have led to a fees- and affiliation-based 
society, a society wherein members can think and share their writings 
only when they pay fees and are salaried/registered workers of academia 
and/or of related institutions. It means that the field’s products are 
not available to all members of society. The promises and advertisements
 of free and open society prove to be deceptive. The term free and open 
is not always as free or open as promised by virtually all websites and 
their services. The freedom offered on websites, or online journals, is 
only limited to or synonymous with the easiness, maneuverability, or 
clickability of certain (surfing) tasks. It can be said that a website 
can help a population overthrow a dictatorial regime, as was seen in the
 Arab world from early 2010 to late 2011; however, the freedom from 
oppressive forces or regimes is only accidental in the sense that this 
freedom is neither the priority nor the provision of that website. A 
free website does not mean a free society/life. Marcuse can help remedy 
this lacuna, by making the information age an age where 
liberation/emancipation is not an accident. Information science 
literature has not addressed this lacuna.</p>

<p>To illustrate, I will consider the two most influential theories of information: Sense-Making (<a href="paperC30.html#Dervin83">Dervin, 1983</a>, <a href="paperC30.html#Dervin98">1998</a>, <a href="paperC30.html#Dervin03">2003</a>, <a href="paperC30.html#Dervin05">2005</a>; <a href="paperC30.html#Dervin03">Dervin, <em>et al.</em>, 2003</a>) and Social Framework for Information Seeking (<a href="paperC30.html#Hargittai06">Hargittai and Hinnant, 2006</a>). As explained below, these two theories have the advantage of drawing on the foundational topics of information science.</p>

<blockquote>The development of Sense-Making began in skeleton form in 
1972, was first articulated as Sense-Making in 1983… Sense-Making is 
proposed as a generalizable approach to thinking about and studying 
human sense making and sense unmaking [of information] in its variant 
forms. Information seeking and use has been a primary substantive focus.
 (<a href="paperC30.html#Dervin05">Dervin, 2005: 26</a>)</blockquote>

<p>Information seeking and use has been foundational to information 
science literature. Consequently, a variety of approaches/areas have 
emerged around the topic of information seeking and use, such as 
information encountering, information grounds, information search 
process, information management, cognitive work analysis, information 
literacy, etc. (<a href="paperC30.html#Fisher05">Fisher, <em>et al.</em>, 2005</a>).
 It does not mean that these approaches are the incarnation of 
Sense-Making, but that they are rooted in the information seeking and 
uses of the individual. From its articulated inception in the 1950s to 
the early 2000s, information science has witnessed a predominantly 
cognitive emphasis in its research. Roughly from the mid-2000s, authors 
have signaled an increasing lack of context-centric research in 
information science literature (<a href="paperC30.html#Afzal06">Afzal, 2006</a>; <a href="paperC30.html#Johnson03">Johnson, 2003</a>, <a href="paperC30.html#Johnson09">2009</a>, <a href="paperC30.html#Fisher09">Fisher and Julien, 2009</a>).
 Note that the mentalistic/cognitive focus is only a fraction of human 
reality. Therefore, with its inattention to context, the mentalistic 
perspective damages/limits the full freedom/emancipation of humans in 
the Marcusian sense of the word.</p> 

<p>The second most influential theory of information behaviour is the Social Framework for Information Seeking (<a href="paperC30.html#Hargittai06">Hargittai and Hinnant, 2006</a>).
 As concerns about the lack of context abound, information science has 
seen a surge of interest in the broader dimensions of information 
behaviour, such as environment, life, context, society, etc.  Context to
 its full extent/meaning is foundational to information science. 
Attempts have been made to focus on the broader/holistic/integrated 
contours of information and its agents. "We integrate work from 
information science, sociology, and other disciplines to argue for a 
more holistic approach to the study of HIB [human information behavior]"
 (<a href="paperC30.html#Hargittai06">Hargittai and Hinnant, 2006: 56</a>). Though 
they looked at the social framework of information, Hargittai and 
Hinnant argued for a holistic research approach. Calls for 
context-embedded research have spawned a variety of research areas in 
information science (<a href="paperC30.html#Borlund10">Borlund, 2010; </a><a href="paperC30.html#Spink06a">Spink and Cole, 2006a</a>, <a href="paperC30.html#Spink06b">2006b</a>; <a href="paperC30.html#Spink11a">Spink and Heinström, 2011a</a>, <a href="paperC30.html#Spink11b">2011b</a>, <a href="paperC30.html#Widen10">Widén, 2010</a>). In the 2010s, the concept of information behaviour has taken an integrated dimension.</p> 

<blockquote>Information behaviour is conceptualized as complex human 
information-related processes that are embedded within an individual’s 
everyday social and life processes. Information behaviour is an 
important part of human condition… Emerging frameworks, models and 
theories are providing a more complex view of information behaviour that
 includes evolutionary and developmental foundations, meta-synthesis, 
individual and contextual dimensions, information interaction, impact of
 information and longitudinal process models. (<a href="paperC30.html#Spink11a">Spink and Heinström, 2011a: xvii</a>)  </blockquote>

<p>Approaches have been broadened and information behaviour has ceased 
to be the sole province of mental/cognitive functions. Though the 
interpreted/contextual theories have been an amelioration of the 
mentalistic approach, they are faced with the behaviourist pitfall(s). 
Davis and Shaw (<a href="paperC30.html#Davis11">2011</a>) noted, "information 
behavior research is part of the behavioral sciences and may be 
associated with the highly criticized behaviorist approach" (p. 27). 
Behavior(ism) implies mechanical, predictable, and marketable 
tasks/entities. Simply put, human reality thrives on a much larger realm
 than that of behaviour. As it is now clear, freedom cannot be reduced 
to a behavioural/marketable task. Marcuse made an extensive criticism 
against the market-oriented tendency of technological rationality (see 
comments and footnotes <a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse41a">Marcuse, 1941a: 419, 429-430</a>).</p>    

<p>Both the mentalistic and behaviourist flaws looming in information 
science research cannot warrant the fuller freedom of individuals, and 
therefore render Marcuse’s work all the more relevant for information 
science. Furthermore, the sense-making and contextual approaches lack 
negative thinking. The sense-making and contextual approaches are merely
 expository, conformistic, or positivistic, as Marcuse (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse64">1964</a>)
 would phrase it, in the sense that reality is simply accepted as a 
given. Marcuse presented a number of areas of criticism. This paper 
captures some of the most important, yet untapped, contributions of 
Marcuse, namely, his sharp inquiry into the ideas of human needs, 
freedom, and privacy. These and similar ideas have remained 
un-criticized and taken for granted.</p>
	
<h2>Negative thinking</h2>

<p>Negative thinking is the thinking that guarantees the freedom of 
humans in the face of ever luring and attractive new technologies. The 
word negative is not taken in the harmful way, but in the sense of 
autonomous, non-manipulated, creative, liberating, or critical thinking.
 <em>The Oxford American Dictionary</em> defines the word negative as expressing 
denial, prohibition, or refusal. Negative thought is one that denies or 
refuses allegiance to something or someone. What is meant behind 
negative thinking is creative or unimpeded reason. Marcuse (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse41a">1941a</a>) explained,</p>

<blockquote>In manipulating [using] the machine, man learns that 
obedience to the directions is the only way to obtain desired results. 
Getting along is identical with adjustment to the apparatus [system]. 
There is no room for autonomy. Individualistic rationality has developed
 into efficient compliance with pregiven continuum of means and ends. 
The latter absorbs the liberating efforts of thought, and the various 
functions of reason converge upon the unconditional maintenance of the 
apparatus. (p. 419) </blockquote>

<p>Adjustments to new technologies and their standards (illustration 
below) become the norm of human behaviour and thinking. Thinking must be
 associated with creativity to free oneself from one-dimensional 
rationality, so to speak. Thinking flows from not one dimensionality, 
but rather from the totality of reality and beings.   </p> 

<p>It is time to negate the highly sensationalized and publicized 
promises and advances of new information technologies. The uncritical 
adoption of and immersion into the information age ruins the freedom of 
humans. In order to ensure the freedom of humans, Marcuse suggested 
negative thinking also called dialectical or critical. Marcuse (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse60">1960</a>) wrote,</p>

<blockquote>The power of negative thinking is the driving power of 
dialectical thought, used as a tool for analyzing the world of facts in 
terms of its internal inadequacy. I choose this vague and unscientific 
formulation in order to sharpen the contrast between dialectical and 
undialectical thinking… Dialectical thought invalidates the a priori 
opposition of value and fact by understanding all facts as stages of a 
single process. (p. viii)</blockquote>

<p>In simpler terms, undialectical thought is one that is conformistic, instrumental, and uncritical of new technologies. </p> 

<blockquote>The negation which dialectic applies to them [facts] is not 
only a critique of a conformistic logic… It is also a critique of the 
given state of affairs on its own grounds – of the established system of
 life, which denies its own promises and potentialities… Progress 
becomes quantitative and tends to delay indefinitely the turn from 
quantity to quality – that is <em>the emergence of new modes of existence 
with new forms of reason and freedom</em> [emphasis added]. (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse60">Marcuse, 1960, pp. vii-viii</a>) </blockquote>

<p>It is the case that with new information technologies, change happens
 at a mind-blinding speed. New digital devices shape us and we shape 
them. The change, however, entails more the usability, fixability, and 
materiality of website, document, and avatar than the actualization of 
humans. There is change with new information technologies, but this 
change is purely nominal/quantitative, namely the mass adoption and 
subscription of people, leaving aside the quality of people life and 
their new forms of reason and freedom.</p>

<p>Marcuse’s vision is not much about merely social revolution and the 
reversal of the status-quo as it is about the subtly dominating effects 
of new technologies upon human behaviour.</p>

<blockquote>The point is that today the apparatus to which the 
individual is to adjust and adapt himself is so rational that individual
 protest and liberation appears not only as hopeless but as utterly 
irrational. The system of life created by modern industry is one of the 
highest expediency, convenience and efficiency. Reason, once defined in 
these terms, becomes equivalent to an activity which perpetuates this 
world. Rational behaviour becomes identical with a matter-of-factness 
which teaches reasonable submissiveness and thus guarantees getting 
along in the prevailing system… The idea of compliant efficiency 
perfectly illustrates the structure of technological rationality. 
Rationality is being transformed from a critical force into one of 
adjustment and compliance [with the system]. Autonomy of reason loses 
its meaning in the same measure as the thoughts, feelings and actions of
 men are shaped by the technical requirements of the apparatus which 
they have themselves created. Reason has found its resting place in the 
system of standardized control, production and consumption. There it 
reigns through the laws and mechanisms which insure the efficiency, 
expediency and coherence of the system. (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse41a">Marcuse, 1941a, pp. 421-422</a>)</blockquote>

<p>The idea of efficiency demands a certain human behaviour of 
submission to the machine and its features. Our reason can be affected 
by the long held machine-complacency to the point where new information 
technology and its uses (e.g., Web, social media sites, online journals,
 etc.) are not criticized, but simply celebrated and deified. "Reason 
was held to be the result of free and autonomous judgment, and the 
rational was that activity which followed this judgment" (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse41b">Marcuse, 1941b: 144</a>). The strongest indication of this rationality-inhibiting trend is the ubiquity of information age/means. Marcuse (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse41a">1941a</a>)
 noted, "several influences have conspired to bring about the social 
impotence of critical thought. The foremost among them is the growth of 
the industrial apparatus and of its all-embracing control over all 
spheres of life" (p. 424). Ubiquity of information can occult or favor 
uncritical thinking. Affected reason can damage both the consumer and 
the designer of the machine. "This training in ‘matter of factness 
applies not only to the factory worker [consumers] but also to those who
 direct rather than attend the machine" (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse41a">Marcuse, 1941a: 418</a>, see footnote 9). The information age tends to discount the (human) fate of machine designers. </p>    
	
<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>One of the most common concepts of information science’s literature is
 privacy. Privacy remains a nightmare when it comes to a number of 
websites and their handling of personal information. </p>

<p>With the dawn of the Internet, the apparatus of disclosure [of 
secret] entered a Cambrian explosion, replicating its effective 
features, excising its failed components, and honing its methods faster 
than ever before. The state of the world’s information favors the leaker 
now more than ever… Digital information already accounted for 97 percent
 of the world’s recorded information. All of that information is <em>liquid</em> 
[emphasis in original]: infinitely reproducible, frictionlessly mobile –
 fundamentally leakable… The numbers of people who have access to that 
material are just as unfathomable. Four million Americans have some form
 of clearance to read classified information. (<a href="paperC30.html#Greenberg12">Greenberg, 2012: 5</a>)</p>  

<p>With digital information, technology can become a nuisance. Websites 
have been trying to assure their customers with protective measures of 
privacy. The reason being, "privacy concerns can greatly hinder 
consumers intentions to interact with a website. The success of a 
website therefore depends on its ability to improve consumers 
perceptions of privacy assurance" (<a href="paperC30.html#Lowry12">Lowry <em>et al.</em>, 2012: 755</a>).
 Perceived assurances do not fix the problem. Perceptualism or mentalism
 do not achieve freedom. Marcuse proposed, however, a different take on 
privacy, with freedom being the overarching idea.</p> 

<blockquote>The idea of "inner freedom" here has its reality: it 
designates the private space in which man may become and remain 
"himself." Today this private space has been invaded and whittled down 
by technological reality. Mass production and mass distribution claim 
the <em>entire</em> individual [emphasis in original]. (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse64">Marcuse, 1964: 10</a>)</blockquote>

<p>Privacy for Marcuse is a milieu of inner freedom, not just the 
usability of the system or the freedom of being left alone. Individual 
freedom can be easily absorbed and supplanted by large-scale 
technologies of modern societies (for further privacy research, see, 
among others, <a href="paperC30.html#Andrews11">Andrews, 2011</a>; <a href="paperC30.html#Claypoole12">Claypoole and Payton, 2012</a>; <a href="paperC30.html#Kasper05">Kasper, 2005</a>; <a href="paperC30.html#Relyea08">Relyea, 2008</a>; <a href="paperC30.html#Sloan">Sloan and Warner, in press</a>).
 Being a part of the new system of information is simply being civilized
 or up-to-date. With new information technologies, the room for refusal 
becomes rare, if not irrational. Information technologies and their 
features and sites are often presented and received as naturalized 
givens or, to borrow one of Marcuse’s central expressions, factualities, 
whose designers, owners, and policy makers are not and cannot be 
questioned. This is the core reason for Marcuse’s battle and dream of 
human freedom that technological progress threatens.</p> 

<p>Contrary to popular belief, liberation for Marcuse does not consist 
in a mere change of institutions and those in power. Marcuse (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse74">1974</a>)
 noted, "I stressed that liberation cannot be expected as a by-product 
of new institutions [however capitalist, socialist, or non-fascist], 
that it must emerge in the individuals themselves" (p. 288). Individuals
 remain the guarantors and makers of (their own) liberation.</p>  

<p>Oftentimes, freedom is defined as the choice that people are given about their information content and design. Marcuse (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse64">1964</a>) warned,</p>

<blockquote>The range of choice open to the individual is not the decisive factor in determining the degree of human freedom, but <em>what</em> can be chosen and what <em>is</em>
 chosen by the individual. The criterion for free choice can never be an
 absolute one, but neither is it entirely relative. Free election of 
masters does not abolish the masters or the slaves. Free choice among a 
wide variety of goods and services does not signify freedom… And the 
spontaneous reproduction of superimposed needs by the individual does 
not establish autonomy; it only testifies to the efficacy of the 
controls [emphasis in original]. (pp. 7-8) </blockquote> 

<p>Freedom of choice does not necessarily mean freedom. Humans are not 
free so long as they cannot be the leaders of their daily lives. </p>

<blockquote>Indeed, in the most highly developed areas of contemporary 
society, the transplantation of social into individual needs is so 
effective that the difference between them seems to be purely 
theoretical. Can one really distinguish between the mass media as 
instruments of information and entertainment, and as agents of 
manipulation and indoctrination? Between the automobile as nuisance and 
as convenience? Between the horrors and the comforts of functional 
architecture? Between the work for national defense [peace] and the work
 for corporate gain? We are again confronted with one of the most vexing
 aspects of advanced industrial civilization: the rational character of 
its irrationality. (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse64">Marcuse, 1964, pp. 8-9</a>) </blockquote>

<p>The idea of needs loses its meaning without the total actualization 
of humans. When reason is misused and unused, the irrational becomes 
rational. In more than one way, our needs are simply the needs of the 
information systems to which we ought to adjust (our freedom).</p>       

<blockquote>But freedom… means being not a mere object, but the subject 
of one’s existence; not succumbing to external conditions [of digital 
devices and forums], but transforming factuality into realization. This 
transformation is… the energy of nature and history, the inner structure
 of all being! … Freedom is the innermost dynamic of existence. (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse41">Marcuse, 1941/1960, pp. viii-ix</a>)</blockquote> 

<p>As can be seen, the focus on human needs and the user-centreedness of
 information means does not entail the actual realization of humans. The
 limitations of freedom lead to the concept of operationalism.</p>
 
 <h2>Operationialism and case illustration</h2>

<p>The key point with operationalism is that the totality of human 
behaviour diminishes as new technologies appear. In order for any 
information technology to operate, a sequence of tasks and steps is 
indispensable. The better the tasks are undertaken the safer and more 
sufficient is the technology.  Not only does the efficiency of 
technologies become important but it also rules our behaviour. Marcuse 
argued that these operational restrictions or efficiency standards 
encroach on and diminish the space of human freedom. Another word for 
operationlism is functionalism. </p> 
<p>"The subject of the investigation is human existence in its totality" (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse72">Marcuse, 1972: 14</a>).  Human existence needs to be viewed and experienced in its totality, regardless of technological progress. Marcuse (<a href="paperC30.html#">1964</a>) wrote,</p>

<blockquote>The trend may be related to a development in scientific 
method: operationalism in the physical [sciences], behaviorism in the 
social sciences. The common feature is a total empiricism in the 
treatment of concepts [and individuals]; their meaning is restricted to 
the representation of particular operations [tasks] and behavior. (p. 
12) </blockquote>

<p>Humans perform certain required behaviour in order to ensure the 
efficiency of the product. In this sense, human actions correspond to 
certain imposed functions. This is not to say that humans cannot choose 
the tasks and behaviour they like, but that the efficiency of products 
instills one-dimensional behaviour and thinking in order for the 
products and commodities to best operate. As is now clear, there is no 
such thing as the operation of freedom or existence.</p> 

<p>Freedom is not an object that a group of designers and technologists 
can possess, manipulate, and operate, but an inner reality from and on 
which to strive to live. Freedom flourishes on all dimensions of human 
existence. Marcuse (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse64">1964</a>) mentioned 
<em>operationalism</em> or <em>functionalization</em> of reason and existence that affects
 even the language we use, a language that becomes functional and 
operational, "that orders and organizes, that induces to do, to buy, and
 accept [products]… This is technological reasoning, which tends to 
identify things with their functions" (p. 86). It is tempting to 
identity humans with their technologies, websites, avatars, etc.</p>  
<p>Since reality, identity, and freedom lose their natural potency, 
Marcuse spoke of one-dimensional reality, behaviour, or thinking. The 
fear or challenge is that "Everything cooperates to turn human 
instincts, desires and thoughts into channels that feed the apparatus… 
The relationships among men are increasingly mediated by the machine 
process" (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse41a">Marcuse, 1941a: 420</a>). While 
technologies help realize tremendous benefits for humans, they also 
place some limitations on humans. Just like information science, 
technological rationality presented human needs, instincts, appetites, 
etc. as mere instances of "physiological individualization" (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse41a">Marcuse, 1941a: 437</a>,
 see footnote 42) or entities in and of themselves. The physiologism of 
needs has caused information science to minimize the power of 
reason/criticism. Human existence cannot be reduced to information 
technologies factualities and their improved functionalities, nor thrive
 on the physiologism of needs. This characteristic of our nature brings 
home Marcuse’s indefatigable fight and dream.  So long as the fuller 
realization of humans is not our primary preoccupation and endeavor we 
live as immigrants in our own land(s), robbed from (basic) freedoms, and
 we betray information science’s pioneers who were visionaries, and not 
mere acclaimers of the technologies adopted in their times. </p>

<p>Paul M.G. Otlet (1868-1944), a great figure of our field, merits mention here. While Otlet (<a href="paperC30.html#Otlet34">1934</a>)
 concerned himself with a quantitative/standardized/codified 
presentation of documents, he was a vocal defender of a fair and 
digital/interactive society (<a href="paperC30.html#Otlet35">Otlet, 1935</a>), a 
society based on welfare and liberation. In information science, Otlet 
is mostly known for, if not limited to, the concept of document (see <a href="paperC30.html#Davis11">Davis and Shaw, 2011: 20</a>).
 Consequently, much of the Otletian legacy/work remains unknown and 
misrepresented. Beside documentalists, for example, the <em>Traité de 
Documention</em> was dedicated to humanists and universalists (of 
world/societal values). More pertinently, Otlet (<a href="paperC30.html#Otlet34">1934</a>)
 wrote, "notre temps, parmi tous les autres, se caractérise par des 
tendances générales… machinisme, internationalisation, développement 
considérable des sciences et des techniques, préoccupation d'en appliquer
 les données au progrès des sociétés" (see Presentation section). The 
ideas of liberation and societal progress transcend by far the common 
understanding of a document.</p>  

<p>A case illustration is helpful. Our field is graced with five most 
important scholarly journals, whose productivity rate continues to rise:
 (1) <em>Journal of the American Society of Information Science and 
Technology</em>, (2) <em>Library &amp; Information Science Research</em>, (3) <em>Journal 
of Documentation</em>, (4) <em>Journal of Information Science</em>, and (5) 
<em>Information Research</em>. The features attached to these journals display 
interesting patterns, in light of Marcuse’s reflections. Of these 
journals, only <em>Information Research</em> provides free access to its products
 whereas others require institution-affiliated access. In other words, 
not only does a person have to be affiliated with an institution in 
order to publish items or access the published information, but the 
institution must be subscribed or cover the (annual) fees of 
publication. Not every industry or university institution covers the 
subscription fees of our journals. Therefore, too many humans, rich or 
poor, jobless or workers, are deprived from our journals products. This 
and similar phenomena markedly contrast with the high tech civilized 
world that we claim to be. Clearly, these phenomena are all operational,
 functional, uncritical, irrational, one-dimensional, or undialectical 
behaviour and thinking in the Marcusian sense, which impact and cripple 
human freedom. </p>

<p>Moreover, as is now accepted as the norm of the information age, the 
published items are, mostly, if not exclusively accessible online in 
that a person cannot walk in a public or university library and read the
 items. Even students must be actually registered; our alumni are 
required to pay all the fees as well in order to access the items. Items
 published in the 1970s, 1960s, 1950s, or earlier are offline and only 
accessible upon extra fees payment, for both affiliated and non- 
affiliated readers. Subscription to one journal does not imply 
subscription to another. Some journals offer their items for free on the
 first months upon release. There again, items are fee-restricted after 
that grace period. An article on <em>Library &amp; Information Science 
Research</em> can be purchased by non-affiliated readers at $39.95. Note that
 in order to publish a research paper, for example, one can peruse a 
thousand or more fee-based articles, not to mention the number of 
published items accessed during casual and routine reading. Moreover, 
owing to constraining requirements of information technologies (e.g., 
maintenance, upgrade, spam, sponsoring cost, etc.) restrictions on 
information and its features are only getting tougher and all the more 
irrational. The information age is not as free or liberating as it 
promises. Information science is called to be the vanguard of human 
fulfillment in our information-swamped societies. The fuller 
actualization of humans should not be left to peripheral or marginalized
 groups, individuals, and efforts, but should constitute the driving 
forces of our societies and of our field, its publications, and venues.</p>       

<p>The information age is establishing a fee-based society, a society 
where in order to think and participate one must comply with 
constraining conditions such as affiliation, account, and fees. In 
replacement of democracy, a society ruled by the people, for the people,
 and with the people, the information age is taking us to a fee-cracy, 
affiliation-cracy, and account-cracy. The fundamental freedom/need of 
humans to think (about) and participate in their destiny has come to be a
 fee-, affiliation-, and account-restricted experience. Marcuse (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse41a">1941a</a>)
 elaborated, "the term ‘apparatus [machine/information technology] 
denotes the institutions [affiliation], devices and organizations of 
industry in their prevailing social setting" (p. 417, see footnote 6). 
The one dimensionality of fees, affiliation, and account has escaped 
criticism, and thus has been taken for granted. Fees are simply imposed 
for the purposes of technology (i.e., maintenance, upgrade, safety, 
interaction, etc.), not for human freedom/actualization. The fees have 
nothing to do with the full realization/improvement of human lives 
(e.g., bridges, housing, shelter, retirement, salary raises, health 
care, food, education, etc.).  The fees make education more expensive 
and inaccessible to the average person. The information age is only 
adding more barriers to human fulfillment.</p>

<p>Freedom has become the mere freedom of clicks and uses of information
 technologies. As claimed earlier, inner freedom -- considered to be 
integral to human fulfillment according to Marcuse -- involves more than
 the freedom of (uses) choice. The word inner can be misleading; it 
simply indicates an autonomous, self-ruled and –inspired freedom. 
Without the self-rule and -inspiration, freedom, and in fact all kinds 
of freedoms, loses its nature and goal, and becomes a mere manipulation 
or instrumentalization (for further research on freedom see <a href="paperC30.html#Fagan10">Fagan, 2010</a>; <a href="paperC30.html#Frazier12">Frazier, 2012</a>,
 among others). The information age has been establishing the freedom of
 clicks and uses of information, leaving aside the inner freedom, the 
very nature of freedom. "The individual in the crowd is certainly not 
the one whom the individualistic principle exhorted to develop his self,
 nor is his self-interest the same as the rational interest" (<a href="paperC30.html#Marcuse41a">Marcuse, 1941a: 428</a>).
 The information age has been producing more efficient clickers in place
 of freer individuals. The best example is with happiness. It is 
completely simplistic to envisage happiness as a mere exterior endeavor,
 devoid of all participation and involvement of the concerned/self. 
Without autonomy, happiness is a mere montage/advertisement. However 
optimal or flawless it can be, the manipulation of tools or websites 
does not achieve freedom. A freedom that does not involve the (inner) 
self or the fullness of the individual is a 
faulty/destructive/consumerist freedom. Therefore, freedom of choice, 
needs, or uses is a manipulative freedom.</p> 

<p>In addition, the theme of development, which is central to 
information and communication technologies for development, can serve as
 a boost for information science to go beyond the mere usability and 
user-centreedness of information. information and communication 
technologies for development (<a href="paperC30.html#Heeks09">Heeks and Molla, 2009</a>; <a href="paperC30.html#Heeks13">Heeks and Seo-Zindy, 2013</a>; <a href="paperC30.html#Walsham13">Walsham, 2013</a>)
 can also capitalize on Marcuse’s insights regarding the actualization of
 humans or development. Marcuse’s insights provide a framework beyond 
mere economic and technological development. The field of information 
and communication technologies for development has long invested in the 
empowerment of the world’s poorest with the idea of bottom-up theory. 
However, the liberation of the individual, be it from the West or local 
forces (dictatorships) has remained unaddressed.</p>  

<p>One of the most cited and praised trails of research in information 
and communication technologies for development literature is 
participatory development. participatory development becomes a powerful 
tool to involve and empower the world’s poorest populations. 
</p><blockquote>According to the strongest advocates of PD 
[participatory development], "normal" development is characterized by 
biases – Eurocentricism, positivism and top-downism – which are 
disempowering… The tendency is to equate development with the modernity 
achieved by ‘western societies and to copy them through planning by 
experts. (<a href="paperC30.html#Mohan08">Mohan, 2008: 46</a>)</blockquote>

<p>The goal is to avoid Eurocentrist agendas to involve and empower the 
concerned. By directly involving those concerned in the development 
project, in contrast to traditional development discourse whose 
programme springs from and pertains to experts, participatory 
development has made the local communities as leaders of their own 
development. Participatory development has taken several forms, the 
majority of which has been to empower women and combat genderism. 
Participatory development builds on Freire’s (<a href="paperC30.html#Freire06">2006</a>)
 philosophy, which gives power to subjects (students) in the process of 
learning so that they become designers, not consumers, of learning. 
Participatory development replaces the top-down power system with an 
equal-to-equal power sharing. </p>
<blockquote>To promote broad-based growth, people must be empowered and 
have the opportunity to make choices that improve their well-being… To 
achieve broad-based economic growth, all people must have equal 
opportunity to participate. Equality of opportunity does not mean 
equality of outcomes. (<a href="paperC30.html#World07">World Bank, 2007: 22</a>)</blockquote>

<p>The idea criticized here is the logical/controllable frame concept of
 quantified outcomes, at the expense of people’s values such as 
participation, involvement, or empowerment. As Mohan and Stokke noted, 
"this [line of thought] has led to the emergence of the ‘local as the 
site of empowerment and hence a locus of knowledge generation and 
development intervention" (<a href="paperC30.html#Mohan00">2000, pp. 247-248</a>). Participatory development authors disapprove of Europe-imported projects of development. Clark (<a href="paperC30.html#Clark07">2007</a>)
 noted, "participatory poverty research movement… has grown into a vast 
industry over the last two or three decades and has come to represent a 
defining feature of contemporary development studies" (p. 14). Various 
projects have emerged under the banner of participatory development.  
</p><p>One powerful example of participatory development is the Grameen Bank project (<a href="paperC30.html#Singhal05">Singhal <em>et al.</em>, 2005</a>; <a href="paperC30.html#Khandker95">Khandker and Khalily, 1995</a>; <a href="paperC30.html#Sachs05">Sachs, 2005</a>)
 in Bangladesh wherein a rural project of cell phone use empowered 
scores of village women to run businesses. "Rural women in Bangladesh 
also became increasingly empowered through the Village Phone Project" (<a href="paperC30.html#Singhal05">Singhal <em>et al.</em>, 2005: 431</a>).
  Despite successes such as these, participatory development is 
criticized for failing to eliminate inequities among newly empowered 
populations. Grameen Bank "propagates inequity by disallowing the most 
disadvantaged rural women to participate" (<a href="paperC30.html#Singhal05">Singhal <em>et al.</em>, 2005: 433</a>).
 The focus of this school of thought is more on participatory 
empowerment of the concerned than anything else. Marcuse’s lenses can 
help liberate the individual from both the local- and 
international-driven inequalities.</p>  
<p>Also worth-noting in this section of case illustration are the 
limitations encountered in Marcuse’s work, the most salient of which are 
(1) his extensive philosophical jargon, (2) lack of a clearly defined 
plan of liberation, and (3) multifaceted topics of interest. An 
effective reader of Marcuse is called to have significant exposure to 
and/or expertise in philosophical discussions. To be precise, the 
interest that the Frankfurt School’s leaders had found in Marcuse’s work 
inscribed itself primarily in philosophy. Adorno (<a href="paperC30.html#Adorno32">1932</a>)
 noted, "Marcuse’s Unternehmen, gerichtet auf System-tragenden 
‘Seinentwurf Hegels, wird gefördet durch dessen eigene philosophische 
Vorgeschichte" (p. 409). Marcuse’s insistence on un-manipulated 
freedom/liberation defeats any attempt of a pre-determined plan/recipe 
of liberation. Marcuse’s work encompasses a wide-ranging variety of human
 conditions. Despite these limitations, Marcuse’s legacy presents an 
immense wealth of research for information science and the information 
age.</p> 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We have to see and envision further than our nose. While they had 
been a response to and an analysis of Hitler’s accession to power and the
 Second World War, Marcuse’s claims have gained greater relevance in our 
ceaselessly unjust and information-intensive societies. Marcuse’s 
writings supply a fresher perspective for information science’s 
literature, especially the effects and uses of information upon 
individuals. Marcuse’s writings can help information science capture anew
 the challenges of information technologies. Information science can 
move beyond the mentalism, behaviourism, and physiologism of information
 needs and uses.</p>
