<section>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The publication of research results by private companies might appear to  run counter to their interests. Initially, private business is geared more to  obtaining and appropriating property rights than to seeking acknowledgement for  discoveries or breakthroughs, a <em>modus  operandi</em> more often associated with the rewards for scientific research. The pursuit of  recognition, which entails sharing discoveries in short order, primarily  through publication, predominates in academic science as the way to establish  property rights over findings. Private sector activities are less prone to be  freely disclosed, inasmuch as such disclosure could have an adverse impact on  the profit to be earned from the invention or technology in question. Consequently,  the codes of conduct governing academic science and industrial research differ,  with the former oriented more to the public and the latter to the private  domain (<a href="paper692.html#16">Dasgupta and David, 1987</a>, <a href="paper692.html#17">1994</a>; <a href="paper692.html#69">Stephan, 1996</a>; <a href="paper692.html#75">Ziman, 1998</a>).</p>
<p>
  These two approaches are the idealised extremes of a <em>continuum</em> whose bounds have been blurred  by the increasing inter-linkage and intricacy of the institutional structures  that govern scientific practice in the two domains.Many academic  researchers who work out of public laboratories or universities are at the same  time involved in the privatisation of knowledge through patents, the founding  of science-based companies and other activities geared to commercialising and  transferring the technology stemming from their research findings (<a href="paper692.html#20">Etzkowitz,  1998</a>). The result is divergence between the private rights associated with such  activities and the scientific rules on basic research, which envisage the  publication of results (<a href="paper692.html#46">Merton, 1985</a>). On occasion, academic researchers engaging in private  activities publish their results selectively and hold back key data or  techniques in connection with their research with a view to reaping higher  future profits, such as in research-intensive companies (<a href="paper692.html#74">Walsh, Cohen and Cho,  2007</a>). Hence, depending  on the reward system, today's academic researchers, life science researchers in  particular, discriminate about information that is to be freely or partially  disclosed, and information to be kept confidential, depending on the commercial  interests at stake (<a href="paper692.html#8">Blumenthal <em>et al</em>.,  1997</a>).</p>
<p>
  Similarly, researchers in private companies also publish the results of  their (essentially applied) research (<a href="paper692.html#51">Nelson, 1959</a>). The possible motivations for so doing have been  described, in theory at least. Publication has been viewed as an avenue for a company  to improve its research results; for private researchers to switch jobs more  easily, having gained recognition in other spheres where research is also  conducted; and for companies to recruit high level researchers and garner  interest for their products, improve their corporate image and favour interconnection  and collaboration (<a href="paper692.html#59">Rosenberg, 1990</a>; <a href="paper692.html#36">Hicks, 1995</a>). In research-intensive companies, such as biotechnology  firms, researchers are authorised and encouraged in a number of ways to publish  their results, but they are less frequently allowed to pursue lines of research  in which they were involved prior to joining the company (<a href="paper692.html#70">Stern, 2004</a>). Companies whose  founders hold PhDs are more prone to establish liberal scientific publication  policies (<a href="paper692.html#19">Ding, 2011</a>). In the pharmaceutical industry, where technological  competition is fierce, empirical evidence shows that publishing scientific  articles helps drug companies position their innovations on the marketplace  (<a href="paper692.html#56">Polidoro and Theeke, 2012</a>).</p>
<p>
  It is not unusual, then, for researchers in private companies to publish  scientific papers, albeit less assiduously than their academic peers. In the 1980s,  companies engaging in the publication of research were located primarily in the  United States, Japan, Switzerland and the Federal Republic of Germany. On  occasion, publications authored by high technology, research and development-intensive  firms conducting business in electronics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals or  information technology, made significant contributions to the literature in engineering,  physics, technology, life science or chemistry (<a href="paper692.html#33">Godin, 1996</a>).</p>
<p>
  Such projects are frequently conducted in conjunction with university  researchers. Tijssen, van Leeuwen and Korevaar (<a href="paper692.html#72">1996</a>) analysed co-authorship patterns in five major Dutch  multi-national companies in conjunction with the subject areas of their core  business. In a study  conducted on company production and partnering in Sweden, Okubo (<a href="paper692.html#54">2000</a>) observed  a gradual increase in the internationalisation of Swedish enterprise's  scientific output in research-intensive areas: biotechnology, engineering and  chemistry. Calvert and Patel (<a href="paper692.html#12">2003</a>) published a paper on co-authorship  between private enterprise and the top 20 British universities between 1981 and  2000. Their results  showed that the research majors, along with technical and newly created  universities, engaged most actively in joint publications with companies,  particularly in the pharmaceuticals, electric power and electronic industries.  In Japan, Sun, Negishi and Nishizawa (<a href="paper692.html#71">2007</a>) analysed the co-authorship ties between industry  and universities. They discussed inter-regional differences, showing that universities are  Japanese companies' preferred partners but not vice-versa, and reasoned that  the decline in publishing activity by companies in international journals may  be a symptom of the tendency of companies to participate less often in basic  research during economic recession. They further contended that private sector investment  in research is increasingly geared to applied science directly related to  company output and profit, arguing that basic research can be undertaken by  firms when the economy is healthy, but recessions deter engagement in such  activities. This heightens private sector dependence on the research conducted  by universities, which is not linked to immediate earnings.</p>
<p>
  In Denmark, Frederiksen (<a href="paper692.html#26">2004</a>) analysed Danish company partnering and  citation patterns and concluded that higher citation rates were obtained in  disciplines where papers were signed by a larger number of authors and entailed  greater international collaboration. Abramo <em>et al</em>. (<a href="paper692.html#1">2009</a>) conducted a study on  university-enterprise collaboration in Italy based on co-authorship analysis. The findings  showed that while Italian researchers who partnered with the private sector  published in journals with lower impact than other academics, their  productivity was higher and they tended to engage in more inter-disciplinary  research. Tijssen, van Leeuwen and van Wijk (<a href="paper692.html#73">2009</a>) conducted a macro-study on  papers co-published by the world's 350 major universities in 2002-2006. That paper  advocated the utility of similar assessments as a tool for national and  international comparison of research-oriented universities.</p>
<p>
  Archambault and Larivière (<a href="paper692.html#4">2011</a>) analysed Canadian companies' scientific output and  patents from 1980  to 2005.  Their analysis inferred that  companies awarded patents published scientific papers more geared to basic  research than companies that published papers but did not patent their results.  Moreover, the papers published by the former received more citations and  appeared in journals with a higher citation rate, while their patents were also  cited more intensely.</p>
<p>
  Company-university partnering, inter-company co-authorship and  university-enterprise technology transfer in Spain have all been addressed in the  literature (see, <a href="paper692.html#53">Olmeda-G&oacute;mez <em>et al</em>.,  2008</a>; <a href="paper692.html#55">Perianes-Rodr&iacute;guez <em>et al</em>., 2011</a>;  <a href="paper692.html#11">Caldera and Debande, 2010</a>). Mobility data, in turn, describe certain features of  the growing interaction between Spanish industry and universities (<a href="paper692.html#15">Cruz-Castro and Sanz-Men&eacute;ndez,  2005</a>; <a href="paper692.html#30">Garc&iacute;a, Mas and Polo, 2012</a>). Information has likewise been published on  university professors' propensity to interact with private enterprise (<a href="paper692.html#6">Azagra,  Archontakis and Yegros, 2007</a>), the patents awarded to Spanish universities (e.g.,  <a href="paper692.html#5">Azagra, Fernandez and Gutierrez, 2003</a>) and the relationship between university  location and the establishment of new technology companies (<a href="paper692.html#2">Acosta, Coronado  and Flores, 2011</a>). Nonetheless, bibliometric descriptions of the scientific research  conducted by private enterprise in conjunction with Spanish universities at a  national level have yet to be undertaken. Based on co-authorship metrics, such  studies would identify the domestic and foreign companies that participate in  joint publications with Spanish universities.</p>
<p>
  Co-authorship of scientific papers implies the existence of more than  one author. Institutional  co-authorship means that more than one author affiliation is listed, indicating  that the authors work in several institutions, departments, entities or  countries. It is envisioned as an indirect measure of a certain degree of  collaboration among co-authors (<a href="paper692.html#45">Melin and Person, 1996</a>). In bibliometric  studies (<a href="paper692.html#37">Jeong, Choi and Kim, 2011</a>), it is regarded as the standardised  approach to analysing collaboration (<a href="paper692.html#43">Lundberg <em>et al</em>., 2006</a>) because constitutes a reliable, verifiable and  invariable way to observe joint research activities and obtain reasonable and  comparable information on a significant scale. Its measurement has no effect on  partnering and its analysis is fairly inexpensive, making it one of the most  popular bibliometric indicators (<a href="paper692.html#39">Katz and Martin, 1997</a>), and furthermore  coauthorship relations are a most formal indicator of international  collaboration (<a href="paper692.html#41">Leydesdorff <em>et al.</em>,  2013</a>).</p>
<p>
  The present article, which draws on the literature presented above, is  structured as follows: The first section discusses the objectives and  underlying questions, followed by a description of the origin of the data  and the methodology, in particular the indicators used. The results are set out in the subsequent section, and  discussed in the final part of the article, which also contains the  conclusions.</p>
  
<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>The present study explores research collaboration between public and  private institutions in Spain. More specifically, the objectives are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>describe the  macro-scale, quantitative features of the scientific output of companies  conducting business in Spain</li>
  <li>analyse the  institutional links between Spanish companies, or multi-nationals  including subsidiaries in Spain and Spanish  public universities in terms of co-authorship of scientific and technical  papers published in international journals.</li>
</ul>

<p>The questions that the study seeks to answer are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>how does the  number of papers authored or co-authored by private enterprise compare to the  number involving all other institutional sectors: universities, public research  bodies and hospitals? </li>
  <li>does enterprise  specialise in any given areas? If so, in which? </li>
  <li>which companies  and universities in Spain co-publish with each other most intensely? </li>
  <li>what is the origin  and geographic distribution of the companies involved? Where in Spain do universities co-publish most  intensely with private enterprise? </li>
</ul>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<h3>Source  of data</h3>
<p>
  This article contains a secondary analysis of bibliometric data on  research institutions drawn from the Scimago institutions ranking database (<a href="paper692.html#64">Scimago,  2012a</a>). Scimago  institutional rankings contain bibliometric indicators on scientific output,  impact, subject specialisation and international collaboration for institutions  engaging in research the world over. These data are derived from Scopus,  Elsevier's abstract and citation database. Scopus has wide research journals coverage (<a href="paper692.html#49">Moya-Aneg&oacute;n <em>et al</em>., 2007</a>), with 19,400  titles as of November 2012 (<a href="paper692.html#66">Scopus, 2012</a>) and a broader scope than the Web of Science (<a href="paper692.html#40">Leydesdorff, Moya-Aneg&oacute;n and Guerrero-Bote, 2010</a>). Moreover, it  provides robust tools for measuring national scientific production (<a href="paper692.html#40">Archambault <em>et al</em>., 2009</a>). Scimago  institutional rankings have been used in many bibliometric studies (<a href="paper692.html#48">Moed <em>et al</em>., 2011</a>; <a href="paper692.html#7">Benavent-P&eacute;rez <em>et al</em>., 2012</a>; <a href="paper692.html#9">Bornmann, Moya-Aneg&oacute;n and  Leydesdorff, 2012</a>).</p>
<p>
  The Scimago institutional rankings classifies institutions by sectors,  further to the criteria set out in the Frascati manual (<a href="paper692.html#52">OECD, 2003</a>). These sectors,  e.g., groupings of institutions with common features that engage in research,  are: Government: covering public bodies, departments and bureaus, with a  standing State budget; Health: public and private hospitals, clinics and  medicine-related scientific organizations; Higher education: higher education  institutions or universities; Private: this sector covers all companies, bodies  and institutions whose primary business consists of producing goods and  services for public sale. It also covers not-for-profit institutions essentially  engaging in corporate services and public enterprise, e.g., government-controlled or  government investee companies, and others: foundations, non-governmental organizations,  international organizations and, in general, not-for-profit institutions that  do not operate in the market. The present analysis covered the output of 5,160  institutions across the period in the following categories: government (534), health  (2,687), higher education (97), private (1,211) and others (631).</p>
<p>
  The Scopus subject classification, based on journal classification and  applied in the Scimago institutions ranking, were examined. Scopus divides  journals into 307 <em>specific subject areas</em> based on bibliometric procedures and  peer review (<a href="paper692.html#38">Kähler, 2010</a>). These are, in turn, grouped into twenty-six <em>subject areas</em>  plus one <em>general subject area</em> covering multi- or inter-disciplinary journals  such as <em>Nature</em> or <em>Science</em> (<a href="paper692.html#66">Scopus, 2012</a>).</p>
<p>
  The two fundamentals of co-authorship analysis are the way the concept  is defined and the way jointly signed papers are tallied. In the present  study, a publication was regarded to be co-authored by a university and a  private company when at least one of the addresses in the affiliations referred  to a Spanish university and one to a Spanish company, a foreign subsidiary of a  company withe headquarters in Spain or a company with registered offices abroad  (<a href="paper692.html#32">Glänzel and Schubert, 2004</a>). That means that data were attributed to universities  or companies by virtue of the appearance of the institutional name in the  database address field, denoting the existence of inter-institutional  collaboration. Since not all  forms of collaboration lead to co-authored articles, this type of collaboration  is sometimes termed formal collaboration.</p>
<p>
  Co-authored papers were tallied using the full counting method for technical reasons, in which the entire paper is attributed to each institution mentioned  in the affiliations. If a publication has more than one coauthor (working at different  institutions), each unique collaborating institution receives one full credit. Consequently, the total numbers are greater than the  number of objects in the study, given the non-additive nature of the procedure (<a href="paper692.html#31">Gauffriau, Larsen, Maye, Roulin-Perriard and Ins, 2007</a>).</p>
  
<h3>Indicators</h3>

<p>Output was defined as the total number of papers of all types, including  citable and non-citable documents, published in journals indexed by Scopus,  with an institutional address attributed to a given organization within a  sector, including companies headquartered in Spain or Spanish universities. It  quantifies scientific activity in a sector and can be used to compare activity  between institutions in the same or different sectors.</p>

<p>Citations was taken to mean the  absolute number of citations obtained by an institution's output for citable  documents only (research articles, reviews,  and conference papers) in 2003-2011 published in journals indexed in Scopus. This indicator reflects the merit, quality, or  significance of an institution's research (<a href="paper692.html#67">Smith, 1981</a>).</p>

<p>Citations per paper was defined as  the mean number for an institution's output (research articles, reviews, and conference papers). This  parameter was calculated with a three-year window, as follows: for articles  published in 2003, numbers were tallied in 2003-2005; for articles in 2004, in  2004-2006, and so on. As output was only available through 2011, for the  last two years of the period, 2010 and 2011, the citation windows covered only  two years and one year, respectively.</p>

<p>For the period 2003-2011, the  compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was taken as the percentage-wise difference  in output (number of papers) between 2011 and 2003. It was calculated from the formula  (present value / past value)<sup>1/n</sup>-1, where n = number of years in the  period.</p>

<p>Three types of collaboration were defined and the percentages determined:  international, international/national, and national. Publications resulting from cooperation between  researchers in a Spanish company and authors in one or more foreign countries  were regarded as international publications. Papers involving collaboration between researchers in  at least two Spanish companies and foreign researchers were classified as  international/national. In national publications, all the authors were from  the same country but different companies. This category also covers publications co-authored by  researchers from the same company (intramural collaboration).</p>

<p>The normalised average impact score was defined as the relative  number of citations received by research  articles, reviews, and conference papers in a specific field compared to the  mean worldwide citations received by papers of the same type, year and subject  area. It denotes the scientific impact attained by an institution's output,  calculated in a way that eliminates any influence of institutional size or  disciplinary profile. Citation values were normalised paper-by-paper. The  normalization of the citation values is done on an individual article level. If  the normalization is done on an article level, a few highly cited articles in a  moderately cited research area may contribute disproportionately to the value  of the field normalized citation score.  The values,  expressed in percentage, compare the institution's average impact in a given  field to the mean world impact for the field, normalised to 1; e.g., a score of  0.8 means that the institution's papers were cited 20% less than the  world average and 1.3 that they were cited 30% more than the world average (<a href="paper692.html#58">Rehn and  Kronman, 2008</a>; <a href="paper692.html#44">Lundberg, 2007</a>).</p>

<p>High quality publications  (Q1) was the term used to mean publications published in the world's most  influential journals, e.g., the first quartile (25%) journals in each  subject areas as ranked by the <a href="http://www.scimagojr.com" target="_blank">Scimago Journal Rank</a> indicator (SJR) (<a href="paper692.html#35">Guerrero-Bote and Moya-Aneg&oacute;n, 2012</a>; <a href="paper692.html#65">SCImago, 2012b</a>).</p>

<p>A variation on the indicator  proposed by Frame (<a href="paper692.html#25">1977</a>), known as the activity index (<a href="paper692.html#63">Schubert, Gl&auml;nzel and  Braun, 1988</a>), was used here and called the university-industry co-authorship  index (UICI). This index is a relative measure of the intensity of a given  university's co-authorship with companies in all subject areas (<a href="paper692.html#61">Rousseau and  Yang, 2012</a>; <a href="paper692.html#60">Rousseau, 2012</a>; <a href="paper692.html#68">Stare and Kej&#382;ar, 2014</a>).</p>

<p>UICI university <em>j=</em> the ratio of j's output in collaboration with  industry to the total national university output in collaboration with industry  over j's share in total university scientific output.</p>

<p>Schematically:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="p692formula1.png" alt="formula_1" width="99" height="38" /></p>
<p>where:<br />
  Cj is university <em>j</em>'s output in collaboration with  industry<br />
  CT is the total  national university output in collaboration with industry<br />
  Oj is university <em>j</em>'s share in total university scientific  output</p>
  
<p>UICI=1 is an indication that the percentage of papers published by the  university involving university-enterprise collaboration is the same as its  percentage contribution to national output; UICI&gt;1 means that  university-enterprise collaboration is higher than its share in national  scientific output, and UICI&lt;1, that it is lower.</p>
<p>
  The regional university-industry co-authorship index (RUICI) is a  variation on the preceding formula designed to identify regional differences,  where the individual university values <em>j</em> are replaced by the aggregate value, <em>i</em>,  for all the papers published by the universities concerned in the period  2003-2011.</p>
  
<p>RUICI for region i = the  ratio of the aggregate output of universities in region i in collaboration with  industry to total national output in collaboration with industry over i's share  in total university scientific output.</p>

<p>Schematically:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="p692formula2.png" alt="formula_2" width="139" height="38" /></p>
<p>where:
  Ci is the aggregate output of the universities in region <em>i</em> in collaboration with industry<br />
  CT is the total  national university output in collaboration with industry<br />
  Oi is <em>i</em>'s share in the total national  university scientific output </p>
  
<h3>Overall trends  of private Spanish publications </h3>

<p>The key characteristics of output co-authored by companies in Spain were  first identified.  The  breakdown of scientific output by sectors (Table 1) revealed that the  number of Spanish papers published in international journals grew steadily in  the period, at a rate of 8.4% yearly. This translated into a substantial rise  in Spain's overall scientific performance on the international scale. By 2011, the  country accounted for approximately 3% of total worldwide output (<a href="paper692.html#65">Scimago,  2012b</a>).</p>

  <p>The university sector authored 55.7% of all of Spain's scientific  papers published during the period. Its contribution rose at a compound annual growth rate  of 7.65%. Output by the Health sector came to 22.8 % of the total, while  the public institutions grouped under the heading Government accounted for 18.3d showed the highest pace of growth, with a growth rate of 8.44%. Enterprise (private  sector) published 11 723 papers, for 1.97 per cent of the national total. At -3.17%,  its growth rate was much lower than in any of the other sectors. After peaking at  3.35% of total national output in 2004, its share declined gradually to  just 0.84 % (699 papers) in 2011. According to these figures, in relative terms, Spanish  enterprise's scientific output has been decreasing since 2009.</p>
  <p>
    Its participation declined in step with the downturn in Spanish  investment in research and development. After rising steadily from 2000 to 2008, at a pace of  12.3% yearly from 2000 to 2005 and a somewhat less intense 7.4%  from 2005 to 2010, nominal research and development spending grew by only  0.05% in 2010. In constant euros, i.e., factoring in inflation, the growth rate was  negative: <strong>-</strong>0.9% (<a href="paper692.html#27">Fundaci&oacute;n  Cotec, 2012</a>).</p>
  <p>
    Table 2 gives the output data for Spanish companies by type of  collaboration. The largest  share of company output involved only national organizations, although it  declined across the period. In 2003, 70% of the papers published by  enterprise involved collaboration with no foreign country; i.e., the scale of  internationalisation was very small. By the end of the period, in 2011, that percentage had  declined to 47.2% as a result of the rise in partnering with  organizations in other countries. Hence, the highest compound annual  growth rate in the private sector, at 9.0%, was recorded for output involving more than one  country. The growth rate for national plus international output was 1.6%,  while the rate for papers involving national  collaboration declined, albeit at a much faster pace: -4.3%.</p>

  <h3>Disciplines and impact  </h3>
  
  <p>A number of indicators were calculated to disaggregate Spanish  enterprise scientific output and the impact of its research by discipline  (Table 3). Data for sixteen of a total of twenty-seven scientific fields are given in the  table. In all, 95.8% of private sector output was in these sixteen fields. The first nine  accounted for 89% of total industry output, and three of every ten papers  fell in one of two fields: biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology (18.8),  or medicine (16.6) (column 3). Spain followed approximately the same  pattern as other western European nations in that respect (<a href="paper692.html#54">Okubo and Sj&ouml;berg,  2000</a>; <a href="paper692.html#26">Frederiksen, 2004</a>; <a href="paper692.html#50">Moya-Aneg&oacute;n and Herrero-Solana, 2013</a>). At the same  time, significant research volumes were recorded in engineering, chemistry,  agricultural and biological sciences and computer science, each of which  accounted for upward of 5% of private sector output. The share of fields  such as environmental science or chemical engineering, however, was 3% or  lower.</p>
  <p>
    Private enterprise research effort represented a significant proportion  of Spanish output in certain specific areas (column 7): energy (6.5 %);  veterinary science (4.3%); and pharmacology, toxicology and  pharmaceuticals (3.6%), three of the fields where Spanish industry  concentrated its scientific activity.</p>
    
  <p> The subject area where private sector research was most intense, biochemistry,  genetics and molecular biology, was also the area with the lowest normalised  impact (0.73: column 5), for it was the area where the percentage of papers  published in high quality journals was lowest (15.39%: column 6). In physics and  astronomy, the normalised impact was 1.32 and in the areas with the highest  share of total Spanish research, impact was consistently higher than the world  mean: 1.88 in veterinary science, 1.12 in energy and 1.02 in pharmacology,  toxicology and pharmaceuticals (column 5).  </p>

<p>In this section, we examine citations and publication data of high  quality (% Q1) for company papers in comparison with Spanish papers as a whole.  Industry research is of low quality? Nobody cites industry research? To answer  that question, the normalised average impact score and the percentage of papers  published in high quality journals were calculated for both total Spanish  output and the papers authored by private enterprise (Table 4). According to all  three indicators, national output overall was more visible than industry  output. Nonetheless, in  two five-year periods, 2006-2010 and 2007-2011, the overall and private  enterprise impact values were very close: the percentage of company output  published in high quality journals was also highest in those two periods.</p>

<h3>University-industry research collaboration</h3>

  <p>Table 5 lists the total number of papers  published jointly by private enterprise and the 50 universities that  collaborated most intensely with industry in 2003-2011. With two exceptions, University of Navarra and Ramon  Llull University, which are private, all the universities in the top few  positions were public and located in Catalunya (UB, UAB, UPC), Madrid (UCM,  UAM, UPM), Basque Country (EHU), Valencia (UV) or Navarra (UNAV).</p>
  
<p>Large-scale universities with healthy numbers of  researchers and departments, and a broad academic offering (UB, UCM, UAB, UAM,  UV, EHU)  (<a href="paper692.html#34">G&oacute;mez <em>et al.</em> 2009</a>), co-existed  in this group with technical universities (UPC, UPM) whose publications  specialise across a much narrower range of fields (<a href="paper692.html#42">L&oacute;pez-Illescas, Moya-Aneg&oacute;n  and Moed, 2011</a>). The  propensity to collaborate with private company researchers, as well as the  subject areas addressed, were found to be related to university size. Technical  universities, which are much more prone to establish close links with  companies, were observed to be located in Spanish regions where research and  development spending amounts to a larger percentage of the regional gross  domestic product than the national average (0.72): the Basque Country (1.63), Navarra (1.51), Madrid  (1.13) and Catalunya (0.99) (<a href="paper692.html#27">Fundaci&oacute;n Cotec 2012</a>).</p>

<p>The  universities in Catalunya and the Balearic Islands (UB, UAB, UPC, UPF, UIB,  UGI, UDL, URV) are less inclined to publish scientific papers with companies  sited in Spain than with companies headquartered abroad (column 5). That finding corroborates the greater  internationalisation of Catalonian institutions' scientific output (<a href="paper692.html#64">SCImago,  2012a</a>).</p>

<p>The scatter plot in Figure 2 shows the  university-enterprise co-authorship index for the 50 Spanish universities  against the absolute number of papers co-authored by universities and companies  in 2003-2011. As the graph  shows, the Technical University of Madrid was the institution with the highest  co-authorship index with companies. Two private universities, U. of Navarra and Ram&oacute;n  Llull U., as well as a public university in Catalunya, Pompeu Fabra U., were  also prone to collaborate with enterprise. The universities with the highest output, such as the  Autonomous University of Barcelona, the Technical University of Barcelona, the  University of Barcelona and the Complutense University of Madrid, likewise exhibited  partnering rates higher than the national mean. Other smaller Madrilenian universities, despite their  concomitantly smaller outputs, such as Rey Juan Carlos University and Carlos  III University, founded in the 1990s, also collaborated with enterprise at a  higher than average rate.</p>

<p>
The group of universities whose partnering with  companies was detectable with these indicators also spanned four universities: the  University of the Basque Country, the University of Oviedo, the Autonomous  University of Madrid and the University of Alcalá de Henares. In all, fifteen  universities in this study had values higher than the national mean, while the  remaining thirty-five exhibited indices of 0.3 (University of Ja&eacute;n) to 0.9 (Public  University of Navarra).</p>

<p>Table 6 contains information on the collaboration  conducted by the universities in the six highest positions in Table 5. Their top ten  partners were primarily pharmaceutical companies. Nonetheless, a small number of information technology,  engineering and biotechnology companies also appeared on the list.</p>

<p>Table 6 likewise shows that these universities  had a sizeable number of partners, ranging from the University of Barcelona's  234 to the Technical University of Madrid's 140. The distribution of research activity varied widely,  however, further to the last row on the table for each university: 53% of  the Complutense University of Madrid's papers co-authored with companies were  written in conjunction with its top ten, whereas the University of Barcelona's  top ten partners accounted for just 19.9% of the joint papers.</p>

<p>Conversely, Table 7 lists the companies that  collaborated most intensely with universities. As might be expected, the pharmaceutical industry  companies (15 of 30) were the most active in this respect, although transport  engineering, petrochemical, microelectronics and telecommunications firms are  also listed. The companies  co-authoring research with universities include a number of domestic and  international heavyweights: RENFE, Repsol and Telef&oacute;nica; and IBM Corporation,  Software Pro and Intel; as well as multi-nationals conducting business in Spain  such as Eli Lilly and Glaxo SmithKline.</p>

<h3>Regional  differences</h3>

  <p>Do companies collaborate more intensely with  universities located in specific regions? Figure 3 confirms that university-enterprise  partnering was distributed along geographical lines. Navarra and Catalunya were the most active regions in  the period studied, with regional university-industry co-authorship indices of  1.5. The second group  are Asturias, Castile-Leon, Madrid and Murcia, whose indices were similar to  their share of nationwide scientific output (regional university-industry  co-authorship index of 1.0 to 1.1). By contrast, university collaboration with enterprise  in the remaining regions exhibited a lower value than their share in overall  output (regional university-industry co-authorship index of 0.5 to 0.9). </p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>The volume and visibility of scientific publications authored by  companies conducting business in Spain did not appear to be very high in the  period studied, compared to the papers published by their academic counterparts.  In absolute and relative terms both, the number of articles published by  companies in international journals declined steadily between 2003 and 2011.</p>

<p>The reasons motivating research in the academic and business sectors are  qualitatively different, in terms both of the type of tasks performed and the  characteristics of researchers' positions. Moreover, the logic and incentives that govern  propagation of research results differ as well.</p>
  
<p>A number of explanations may be put forward for these differences. The first is the  lack of sufficient encouragement for individuals or even companies to publicise  their research results, given the uncertainties and risks entailed in  undertaking research. Even when private research is successful, the results  must often be kept confidential for strategic reasons to ensure the company's  return on its investment (<a href="paper692.html#59">Rosenberg, 1990</a>). In contrast, the logic governing  academic researcher behaviour in this respect is ambivalent. Initially, basic  research findings were openly published (<a href="paper692.html#46">Merton, 1985</a>) in scientific journals,  the vehicles par excellence for academic science. The propensity to appropriate knowledge privately is  no longer unusual in universities, however, as researchers themselves decide if  and when to publicise information fully, partially or not at all, pursuant to  procedures that are not deterministic (<a href="paper692.html#17">Dasgupta and David, 1994</a>).</p>
  
<p>Surveys conducted in other countries have revealed the scant importance  attached by companies to the publication of scientific papers (<a href="paper692.html#47">Meyer-Krahmer  and Schmoch, 1998</a>; <a href="paper692.html#62">Schartinger <em>et al</em>., 2002</a>), for want of time to write  them up, the inadequacy of the research to yield publishable results or  deliberate postponement for patent- or explicit prohibition-related reasons (<a href="paper692.html#18">D'Este,  Nesta and Patel,  2005</a>).</p>
  
<p>In Spain, however, reasons  for publication of a structural nature also come into play. Spain's  industrial core, which consists primarily of low technology companies, is  characterised by a paucity of human resources engaging in private sector research  and development. In 2009, for instance, the percentage of the country's total researchers  employed by the private sector (34.7%) was twenty percentage points lower  than in countries such as France or Germany and seven lower than in Italy.  Moreover, in that year and 2010, the proportion of researchers working in the  private sector shrank by 1.6% yearly (<a href="paper692.html#13">Castro and Fernández,  2006</a>; <a href="paper692.html#27">Fundaci&oacute;n Cotec, 2012</a>; <a href="paper692.html#28">2013</a>). Spain is not a priority investment target for the  world's research and development majors, for it hosts less than 1% of  their total investment (<a href="paper692.html#21">European Union, 2010</a>; <a href="paper692.html#22">2011</a>).</p>
  
<p>As Fernandez Esquinas and Ramos Vielba (<a href="paper692.html#24">2011, p.138</a>) noted, Spanish universities are public bureaucracies  governed by national law in which associate and full professors are public  officials. In contrast to non-university sector flexibility, university hiring  and mobility are subject to very strict formalities and procedures and may  stall career promotion. Moreover, inter-sector research agreements are highly  regulated, especially as regards the exchange of economic resources in both  directions.</p>

<p>Furthermore, partnering with companies was not formally acknowledged as  an integral part of Spanish universities' mission until very recently. No  incentives associated with professional development or promotions were in place  that would encourage the pursuit of links with the private sector. This changed  when Parliament passed Act 14/2011 on Science, Technology and Innovation.</p>
  
<p>Companies publishing papers in peer-reviewed journals,  whether alone or under co-authorship arrangements, attain academic community  regard (Tables 3 and 4). In eleven of the sixteen subject categories, their normalised  impact factors are higher than the worldwide mean. The  companies with the highest impact factors are very careful about the research  findings they publish, aware that they are going to be perused by the  scientific community.</p>
  
<p>That notwithstanding, some companies in Spain, primarily  innovation-intensive firms, while staunchly commercial, maintain a detectable level of peer-reviewed scientific output and links with  universities, as  observed on the occasion of a study on collaboration with Madrilenian  universities in the area of biomedical science (<a href="paper692.html#53">Olmeda-G&oacute;mez <em>et al</em>., 2008</a>). Their reasons often lie in a need to establish links  with outside sources of scientific-technical information or counsel. Moreover, the  publication of scientific papers serves as a means for recruiting and retaining  highly qualified researchers, improves a firm's corporate image, enhances its  technical reputation and credibility and strengthens inter-connections and  partnering (<a href="paper692.html#36">Hicks, 1995</a>).</p>
  
<p>The aforementioned companies engage in R&amp;D-heavy industries:  pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, industrial engineering, software and  information services, chemistry, electrical and electronic equipment, aerospace  and defence, the visibility of  their academic tasks is lower than the national mean and they publish in lower  impact journals than used by institutions in other sectors. They are also less  prone to international collaboration than academic researchers.</p>
  
<p>The Spanish companies collaborating most intensely with Spanish  universities, such as Repsol YPF, Telef&oacute;nica, Pharma Mar, Almirall and others,  including subsidiaries of multi-nationals, are among the 1 500 firms with  the highest research and development investment worldwide. (<a href="paper692.html#23">European Union, 2013</a>). Establishing links with universities is one way to  acquire knowledge they are unable to generate in-house; access to such  knowledge through external sources is a key to innovation in large  corporations. For the small companies listed in Table 6, relations are sought with  universities primarily to solve problems associated with their core business.</p>
  
<p>Firms choose their academic partners from  among the researchers and universities located in regions where research and  development spending is highest (Madrid and Catalunya), which are also home to the universities that lead  research in the Spanish system (<a href="paper692.html#64">Scimago,  2012a</a>). The  number and variety of companies networking with each university is also  indicative of its knowledge transfer capacity. Institutions are also chosen on the grounds of their  size, degree of specialisation in the subject area in question (technical  universities) and geographical proximity, which facilitates cooperation among  organizations with different socio-economic structures (<a href="paper692.html#10">Boschma, 2005</a>; <a href="paper692.html#57">Ponds,  van Oort and Frenken, 2007</a>). Partnering is  consequently distributed along geographical lines and concentrated in regions  with polytechnic institutions (Catalunya, Madrid, Murcia) and high research and  development investment levels, or where the  university plays an instrumental role in regional innovation. Navarra, the  region in Spain with the second highest number of research and development workers  per capita, would exemplify this third type of attraction (<a href="paper692.html#28">Fundaci&oacute;n Cotec,  2013</a>).</p>
  
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This article reports data on the characteristics and volume of the  scientific activity conducted by private enterprise in Spain. It has focused on  cooperation between Spanish universities and business at a national level, for  which the indicator used, was their joint publications.</p>
<p>
  As the present findings show, the number of Spanish  papers published in international journals grew across the entire period, while  the papers involving private sector participation declined steadily after the  2005 peak. The scant volume and steep decline in the number of papers with private  company authorship in the final years of the period studied concurred with a  downward trend in public and private research and development funding for  public universities initiated in 2008. These years were also characterised by a decline in the number of  innovative companies or firms cooperating with universities and producing some  type of innovation. The flow of funds earmarked for technology transfer,  consultancy or research and development contracts with universities has also  ebbed. Hence, the fall in the volume of private sector papers may simply mirror  a cutback in private research and development funding.</p>
<p>
  The disciplinary bias of research papers published by  private companies is slanted toward the areas with a potential for subsequent  economic development. Companies with more highly trained employees, such as  biomedical and biotechnological, engineering, pharmacological or agri-food  firms, are more prone to cooperate with universities and public research  bodies. Between 2003 and 2011, 45% of all Spanish papers with private  sector authors dealt with life science-related matters.</p>
<p>
  The percentage breakdown of collaboration varied over  the period: international partnering rose from 17% of the total in 2003  to 37% in 2011, the same percentage as recorded for national  collaboration in that year. Although the absolute numbers are small, companies conducting  research appear to be seeking ways to internationalise their scientific  activity. Spain, as a peripheral country, must resort to internationalization to  raise the visibility of its research. The rise in international partnering observed may be  an indication of the awareness of that need. Internationalisation  is a two-way street, as proven by the fact that several foreign companies are  among the thirty firms collaborating most frequently with Spanish universities. Visibility can be enhanced by cooperating more intensely with scientists  affiliated with foreign companies or institutions rather than conducting  in-house research and publishing papers with domestic authorship only. That may  help correct the low standardised impact factor attained by Spanish companies  in the field where their scientific output is highest.</p>
<p>
  The authors are aware of two limitations to this study. The first is  that the analysis was based on the results of a review of scientific papers  published in formal international channels only. It did not cover other records that could be analysed  with bibliometric methods, such as patents. Furthermore, the data on universities furnished cannot  prejudge the intensity or variety of their relations with companies, for the  interactions between the two are much broader and more complex than can be  gleaned from an analysis of scientific co-authorship. This paper contributes to the field by casting light  on one of these aspects and describing private sector participation in Spain's  scientific output, measured in terms of papers published. </p>
