<p>   NEW YORK, NEW YORK, U.S.A., 1999 OCT 5 (NB). People who spend a lot of time surfing the Web aren't necessarily cutting back on  television or other sources of news and entertainment, a  study released today says.</p>
<p>  In fact, the every-other-year Pathfinder Study from  Arbitron NewMedia showed that the heaviest users of the Web  may spend slightly more time reading and listening to the  radio or their own stereos than people who don't use the Internet at all.</p>
<p>  Arbitron said surfers who sat in front of their computers  an average of 4.5 hours in a day (the high end of the  Pathfinder survey) watched only slightly less television  (about 12 minutes less) than non-surfers.</p>
<p>  How do heavy users of the Web find the time? Arbitron  spokesman Thom Mocarsky told Newsbytes that many Net- connected survey respondents reported being online and  using other media simultaneously.</p>
<p>  "They would either be listening to radio and surfing the  Web, or watching television and surfing the Web," Mocarsky  said.</p>
<p>  Roberta McConochie, director of research for Arbitron, said  the fact that consumers seem to be multitasking when it  comes to the Web and radio or television "points to the  possibility of some innovative cross-media promotion and  programming."</p>
<p>  McConochie also said, "The slightly lower levels of TV  viewing among the Web population appear more related to the  income, education and age profile of Web users rather than  to any displacement by Internet use."</p>
<p>  The Pathfinder survey of 5,500 US adults found that,  during the peak hour for Web use at work (9 a.m. to 10  a.m.), 26 percent of heavy Web users reported listening to  the radio - a higher share than reported for those who don't use the Internet at all.</p>
<p>  Arbitron said the peak hour for Internet use at home was  between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., when 52 percent of heavy Web  users reported that they watched television, only   slightly lower level than that of all Web users (55 percent) or the total population (59 percent).</p>
<p>  When asked how long they spent with various forms of media  in the day, those who don't use the Web reported watching television for an average of 3.7 hours. Heavy Web users  reported an average of 3.4 hours.</p>
<p>  The off-line crowd averaged 2.4 hours listening to radio,  0.7 hours listening to audio tapes or CDs, 0.7 hours  reading newspapers, and 0.4 hours reading magazines. Heavy  Web users (more than three hours a day) spent 2.9 hours  with the radio, 1.4 hours listening to tapes or CDs, 0.8  hours reading newspapers, and 0.6 hours reading magazines.</p>
<p>  The survey also matched specific preferences in music,  television programs, and reading material with Web-use  levels. Arbitron says heavy Web users prefer classic rock,  "The Simpsons" television show, and the business sections of their newspapers. When they're not watching "The Simpsons,"  heavy Web users' favorite cable television networks are The  Discovery Channel and The Learning Channel.</p>
<p>  Mocarsky said the share of the US population getting online  continues to grow.</p>
<p>  "We've seen a four-fold increase in Web users since 1995,"  he said. "When we first did Pathfinder, we found 10 percent  of adults between the ages of 16 and 74 used the Web. In  1997 that figure was 25 percent. In 1999 that figure is 39  percent."</p>
<p>  Arbitron says additional data from the current Pathfinder  surveys will be released throughout 1999 and 2000.</p>
